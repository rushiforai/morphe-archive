<h1 align="center">🛠️ Morphe Desktop Documentation</h1>

This is the complete documentation for Morphe Desktop. Morphe desktop offers both a GUI and a CLI. The [GUI](#gui) is how most people will use it, with a powerful [CLI](#cli) underneath for power users and automation. This documentation covers both, plus common workflows. If you’re brand new, start with the [first-run guide](../README.md#first-run), then come back here.

Now that you've done your first run, let's dig deeper into how the magic happens and how to make it even better.

<h2 id="prerequisites">🤝 Prerequisites</h2>

1. Java Runtime Environment 21 or above ([Azul Zulu JRE](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-21-lts&package=jre#zulu), [Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases?version=21&os=any&arch=any) or [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/archive/)).
2. Morphe Desktop jar file (morphe-desktop-*-all.jar). Download the latest from [here](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-desktop/releases/latest).
3. If using CLI: Patches mpp file (patches-*.mpp). Download the latest Morphe official patch files from [here](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches/releases/latest).
4. If using CLI: Desired app file (app.apk or app.apkm). Download your apk from [APK Mirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/).
5. [Optional] [Android Debug Bridge (ADB)](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) If you want to install the patched APK file to your device directly from your computer.

<h2 id="where-files-stored">📂 Where Morphe stores its files</h2>

Morphe keeps its runtime data: cached patch files, logs, scratch space for patching, and the default signing keystore in a single **`morphe-data/`** folder. By default, this folder is created **next to the JAR** you run, so it survives upgrades and is easy to find. 
If that location isn't writable (e.g. running from an IDE, or from a read-only install path), Morphe falls back to **`~/morphe/`**. The startup logs print which one is in use (look for `Morphe data root: ...`).

```
morphe-data/
  patches/         # cached .mpp patch bundles
  logs/            # application logs
  tmp/             # per-run patching scratch (the default --temporary-files-path location)
  morphe.keystore  # shared default signing key (see --keystore)
  config.json      # preferences + configured sources
```

Both the GUI and the CLI use this folder. In the GUI you can open it from **Tools → Open App Data**. On the CLI, `--temporary-files-path` defaults to `tmp/` (override it to send scratch elsewhere) and `--keystore` defaults to `morphe.keystore` here.

<h2 id="gui">GUI</h2>

The GUI is the window you get when you double-click the jar and for most people, it's the way to use Morphe. No flags to memorize, no quoting mistakes, no terminal history full of 47 almost-right commands. Point, click and patch.

In your [first run](../README.md#first-run) you used the GUI's **Quick mode**, the beginner-friendly path. Below we go deeper, focusing on **Expert mode**, where you can do much more.

<h3 id="gui-modes">The two modes</h3>

The GUI can run in one of two modes:


| Mode                | Who it's for               | What you control                                                                                                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Quick** (default) | First-timers, fast patches | Just the APK: Morphe picks the patch source and the default patch set                                                                 |
| **Expert**          | Regular users, Power users | Everything: patch source & version, individual patches & their options, native-lib stripping, signing, and a live CLI-command preview |

<p align="center">

  <img src="images/documentation/gui/expert_home.png" width="45%" alt="Expert mode home" style="vertical-align: middle" />
</p>

On first launch you're in **Quick** mode. Switch anytime in **Settings → Expert mode → Toggle ON**. *[Morphe will remember that.]*

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/documentation/gui/expert_mode_on.png" width="60%" alt="Expert mode toggle" style="vertical-align: middle"/>
</p>

<h3 id="gui-quick">Quick mode</h3>

Quick mode is the beginner path, covered step-by-step in the [first-run guide](../README.md#first-run): drop an APK, click **Patch**, watch it run, then install the patched app. Morphe chooses the patch source and the default patch set for you (by default). You can add additional sources here too. 
The rest of this section however focuses on **Expert mode**. That's where the GUI matches (and visualizes) everything the CLI can do. 

<h3 id="gui-expert">Expert mode</h3>

Expert mode is a five-screen pipeline (for now): **Home → Patch source → Patch selection → Patching → Result**. Each screen below lists its controls (and the CLI flag it maps to, where there is one), then explains the details.

<h4 id="gui-window">The TopBar</h4>

The home screen has a top bar (on the top):

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/documentation/gui/topbar.png" width="80%" alt="Topbar" style="vertical-align: middle"/>
</p>

**The sources pill** sits in the center of the bar. It shows the loaded patches version and a **N SOURCES** count, with one small colored LED per source for the release channel it resolved to:

| Control                   | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sources pill** (center) | The loaded patches version + a **N SOURCES** count with one colored LED per source – see below.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Device indicator**      | Shows the connected ADB device (or "No devices connected"). Click to choose the target device for installs.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Tools** (wrench)        | One-off actions + reference info – see [Tools](#gui-tools).                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Settings** (gear)       | All your preferences – see [Settings](#gui-settings).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| LED | Channel           | Meaning                                  |
|-----|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 🟢  | **STABLE LATEST** | newest stable release – recommended      |
| 🟡  | **STABLE OLDER**  | a stable release, but a newer one exists |
| 🔵  | **DEV LATEST**    | newest pre-release (experimental)        |
| 🔴  | **DEV OLDER**     | a pre-release but behind                 |

In Expert mode, click the pill to open the **source manager** – add, remove, refresh, or reorder sources (see [Managing patch sources](#gui-expert-sources)). In Quick mode it's informational. The same LED colors appear on each row inside the source manager.

The rest of the bar is the **device indicator** on the right (your ADB install target – more under [Installing to a device](#gui-adb)), and the two icon buttons next to it: 
**Tools** (the wrench – logs, app data, clear cache, licenses; see [Tools](#gui-tools)) and 
**Settings** (the gear – theme, modes, signing, strip libs, and more; see [Settings](#gui-settings)).

<h4 id="gui-expert-home">1. Pick your APK</h4>


| Control                            | What it does                                                         | CLI equivalent                                                             |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **SUPPORTED APPS** list            | The apps your patches target, each tagged with a recommended version | informational – compare with[`list-versions`](#subcommand-3-list-versions) |
| **CHANGE APK**                     | Swap the selected file                                               | –                                                                          |
| **CONTINUE** / **CONTINUE ANYWAY** | Proceed to patch selection                                           | `--force` (when it reads *ANYWAY*)                                         |

Drop an APK anywhere on the window (the zone reads **DROP APK HERE** → **RELEASE TO DROP**) or use **BROWSE FILES**. Split-APK bundles (`.apkm` / `.xapk` / `.apks`) are merged into a single APK automatically.

The **SUPPORTED APPS** list shows what the loaded patches can target, each with a version tag: 
**STABLE LATEST**, 
**EXPERIMENTAL LATEST**, 
**ALSO STABLE**, 
**EXPERIMENTAL** - so you know which APK version to download. Search it if it's long. 
A second tab, **YOUR APPS**, tracks everything you've already patched, see [Your apps](#gui-your-apps).

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/documentation/gui/supported_apps.png" width="70%" alt="Supported Apps" style="vertical-align: middle"/>
</p>

Once an APK is dropped, Morphe reads its metadata (**ANALYZING** / "Reading app metadata…") and shows an info card with the app name, package, and version, plus **CHANGE APK** and **CONTINUE**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/documentation/gui/home-apk-selected.png" width="60%" alt="Selected Apk" style="vertical-align: middle"/>
</p>

> [!TIP]
> Each version tag in the SUPPORTED APPS list is a clickable shortcut. Click one to open that app's download page on [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/) or other related sites. Grab the recommended version: matching versions means more patches apply.

> [!NOTE]
> If your APK's version doesn't match what the patches expect, the button changes to **CONTINUE ANYWAY**. Proceeding is the GUI's equivalent of the CLI's `--force`. Incompatible patches are skipped, and the ones that do apply may or may not work. Newer-than-recommended versions are usually the riskiest.

<h4 id="gui-expert-source">2. Choose a patch source & version</h4>


| Control                                                                                   | What it does                          | CLI equivalent                                                      |

| **LOCAL PATCH FILE → BROWSE**                                                             | Use a`.mpp` already on disk           | `-p <file.mpp>`                                                     |
| **EXPORT JSON**                                                                           | Save an`options.json` for this bundle | [`options-create`](#subcommand-4-options-create) / `--options-file` |

Morphe fetches the available releases from your configured source and tags them: **LATEST**, **STABLE**, **DEV** (pre-release), and **CACHED** (already downloaded). Pick one and **DOWNLOAD** / **SELECT** it. Expand **PATCH NOTES** to read the changelog first. Already have a `.mpp`? **LOCAL PATCH FILE → BROWSE** points straight at it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/documentation/gui/patches-releases.png" width="60%" alt="Release Screen" style="vertical-align: middle"/>
</p>

> [!NOTE]
> **EXPORT JSON** writes an options file describing every patch and its settings – the same artifact the CLI's [`options-create`](#subcommand-4-options-create) produces. Edit it and feed it back via `--options-file` for repeatable, scriptable runs.

<h5 id="gui-expert-sources">Managing patch sources</h5>

The sources Morphe fetches from are configurable: add community sources (GitHub / GitLab repos, or `morphe.software/add-source` links), remove them, or refresh them. Adding more than one source is the GUI counterpart to passing several `-p` URLs on the CLI: their patches show up together, grouped by bundle, on the next screen.

**Reordering.** Drag a source by its handle to change its position in the list. Order is **load priority** – sources higher in the list are loaded first. This usually doesn't matter, but it can: if two sources ship a class with the same name (common when both are forks of the same patches project), the one loaded first wins. Keeping your primary source on top is the safe default.

**Channel badge.** Each enabled source shows a small badge for the release it resolved to, color-coded by release channel, the same colors (and meanings) as the sources-pill LEDs in [The TopBar](#gui-window).

<h4 id="gui-expert-selection">3. Select patches</h4>

The full patch list from your selected bundle(s), with a running **"N of M selected"** count.

| **Continue patching even if a patch fails**               | Keep going when a patch errors instead of aborting the whole run | `--continue-on-error`                            |
| **COMMAND PREVIEW** (**COPY** / **EXPAND** / **COMPACT**) | The exact CLI command for your selections                        | – (it*is* the CLI command)                       |
| **PATCH (N)**                                             | Start patching the N selected patches                            | runs the`patch` command                          |

- **Toggling & search**: Flip patches on/off. Search filters the list (you'll see *No patches match your search*). If you added multiple sources, patches are grouped per bundle (*No matches in this bundle* when a filter empties one).

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/documentation/gui/patch-selection.png" width="60%" alt="Patch Selection Screen" style="vertical-align: middle"/>
</p>

- **Options**: Patches with configurable options show an options count. Click on this to expand and edit. Values are typed, see the [Value Types Reference](#value-types-reference) for how strings / booleans / lists are formatted. **PATCH DEFAULTS** means untouched. **YOUR DEFAULTS** means you've customized it. A few options are richer than a text box, notably **custom icon** option, which opens the [Icon Studio](#gui-icon-studio) instead.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/documentation/gui/patch-options.png" width="60%" alt="Patch Selection Options" style="vertical-align: middle"/>
</p>

- **Strip libs**: A summary chip shows whether native libs will be stripped (**STRIPPING NATIVE LIBS** / **NO STRIPPING NEEDED** / **NO NATIVE LIBS**). Change the kept architectures under Settings → Strip Libs.
- **Continue patching even if a patch fails**: By default a failed patch aborts the whole run. Enable this to skip the failure and apply the rest. The GUI's equivalent of the CLI's `--continue-on-error`.
- **Command preview**: The exact CLI invocation your choices produce. **COPY** it to reproduce this run in a terminal or drop it into a script. **EXPAND** / **COMPACT** toggles full vs condensed.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/documentation/gui/command-preview.png" width="75%" alt="Command Preview" style="vertical-align: middle"/>
</p>

> [!TIP]
> The Command Preview is the best way to *learn* the CLI: configure a patch visually, copy the command, and you've got a reproducible one-liner. Handy for scripting or sharing exactly what you ran.

<h4 id="gui-icon-studio">Custom app icons (Icon Studio)</h4>

Some patches can replace the app's launcher icon. When a patch exposes a **custom icon** option (for example the **Custom branding** patch on the official Morphe patches), its row in the options editor shows action buttons instead of a plain text field:

| Control                         | What it does                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DESIGN ICON** / **EDIT ICON** | Open the **Icon Studio** to build a new icon (or re-open the one you saved)                    |
| **IMPORT FOLDER**               | Point the option at an already-prepared icon folder. E.g. one exported from the Morphe Manager |
| **DELETE**                      | Clear the icon and delete its saved project + generated files                                  |

The patch expects a specific icon folder on disk, but you never have to build that by hand. The Icon Studio generates it and sets the option to its path. The row reads **Custom icon ready** once set, **No custom icon set** otherwise.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/documentation/gui/icon-studio-option.png" width="60%" alt="Custom icon option row" style="vertical-align: middle"/>

**Foreground vs. background.** Android adaptive icons are two layers: an **opaque background** and a **foreground** on top (the foreground may be transparent). The launcher masks the combined result into whatever shape the device uses. The Icon Studio mirrors this with two panels:

- **FOREGROUND**: Your logo/mark, built from stacked **layers**. Each layer is an **IMAGE**, **TEXT**, or a **SHAPE** (circle, square, rounded, triangle, and more). Per layer you get **TRANSFORM** (move / scale / rotate, with **RESET POSITION**), color, and effects like **SHADOW**, **GLOW**, **STROKE**. Text layers add **BOLD** / **ITALIC** / **UNDERLINE** / **STRIKE**; **DUPLICATE** copies a layer.
- **BACKGROUND**: A **SOLID** color, a **GRADIENT** (**LINEAR** / **RADIAL** / **CONIC**), or an **IMAGE**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Transparency is the #1 reason a custom icon looks wrong**, and the two layers have opposite rules:
> - **The foreground should be transparent** around your mark. That cut-out is what makes the monochrome and notification icons read as a *shape*. A fully opaque foreground turns them into a solid block. If you import an opaque image the Studio **warns you** but won't auto-edit it (that could mangle a real icon). Fix it yourself with a transparent PNG, or use a **TEXT** / **SHAPE** layer instead.
> - **The background must be opaque**. Adaptive backgrounds can't be see-through. Here the Studio handles it *for* you. A transparent background image is **automatically flattened** onto a solid base, so backgrounds just work. (Although it is highly recommended to use a proper, fully opaque background.)

Colors come from a picker with saveable swatches, **TEMPLATES** give you starting points, and **UNDO** / **REDO** cover mistakes. Your work autosaves (the header shows **SAVED**), so **EDIT ICON** reopens exactly where you left off.

**Live previews.** The right side shows how the icon renders in three real contexts:

- **ADAPTIVE** – the normal launcher icon (foreground over background).
- **MONOCHROME** – the themed/monochrome icon (Android 13+): a tinted silhouette of the *foreground*.
- **NOTIFICATION / STATUS BAR** – the small white silhouette used in the status bar and notifications, again derived from the foreground.

Because the monochrome and notification icons come from the foreground's shape and transparency, a background-only icon shows nothing in those two previews. That's expected, and the Studio points it out.

> [!NOTE]
> **PREVIEW SHAPES** (circle, squircle, rounded, square) are only a *preview* of how different launchers might mask your icon. You don't pick the final shape. The device's launcher decides that, so your icon just needs to look right under any of them.

Hit **SAVE ICON** to export the folder and wire it into the option (**CANCEL** discards the current session), then patch as usual – the new icon is applied during patching.

Morphe runs the pipeline and streams the same log lines the CLI prints, with a **patched/total** counter. The log is also saved to disk (`morphe-data/logs/`, reachable via Tools → Open Logs). On failure you'll see **PATCHING FAILED** with the error in the log; on success, **PATCHING COMPLETED – LOADING RESULT…** advances to the result screen. **CANCEL** stops mid-run.

Device states include **UNAUTH** (accept the USB-debugging prompt on the phone) and **UNKNOWN**. If ADB is off you'll see **ENABLE ADB** (turn on Auto-start ADB in Settings).
- **PATCH ANOTHER** restarts the flow; **TEMPORARY FILES → CLEAN UP** frees this run's scratch space (it shows how much).

<h4 id="gui-expert-links">Link handling ("open with")</h4>

After installing to a device, Morphe can make the patched app handle its supported web links, so those links open in the patched app instead of your browser or the stock app. It's ADB-only and fully reversible.

| Control                                            | What it does                                                                                           | CLI equivalent                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **OPEN LINKS WITH PATCHED APP**                    | Route the app's supported web links to it                                                              | [`utility install --route-links`](#utility-install) |
| **Also stop &lt;app&gt; from opening these links** | Hand the stock app's links over too – only when a rename patch was used and the stock app is installed | `--disable-stock <stockPackage>`                    |

The **LINK HANDLING** section appears on the Result screen once the patched app is installed and a device is connected. On success, you'll see *Links routed to patched app* (or *…, stock disabled*); the change is reversible, restoring default link handling. To run it automatically after every ADB install, turn on **Route links to patched app** in [Settings](#gui-settings).

</p>

<h3 id="gui-your-apps">Your apps</h3>

The home screen has two tabs: **SUPPORTED APPS** (what your patches can target) and **YOUR APPS**, a history of everything you've patched with Morphe. The "Your apps" tab carries a count badge, and when newer patches are available a banner ("N patched apps have updates available") jumps you there.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/documentation/gui/your-apps.png" width="60%" alt="Your Apps section" style="vertical-align: middle"/>

Each entry is a card showing the app, the patched version, and when you patched it. Tap one for the full breakdown and actions:


| Action        | What it does                                                                                     | CLI equivalent                            |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **INSTALL**   | Install the patched APK to the connected device (shows**INSTALL READY** when the build is ready) | [`utility install`](#utility-install)     |
| **UPDATE**    | Re-resolve patches and re-patch when a newer patch (or app version) is available                 | re-run[`patch`](#subcommand-1-patch)      |
| **RE-PATCH**  | Patch the same app again with your saved settings                                                | re-run[`patch`](#subcommand-1-patch)      |
| **UNINSTALL** | Remove the patched app from the connected device                                                 | [`utility uninstall`](#utility-uninstall) |
| **FORGET**    | Remove the entry from Your apps (history only – doesn't touch the device)                        | –                                         |

The detail view also lists the app and Morphe versions and a per-source version breakdown, and flags when a newer patch may bump the app version.

**Uninstall vs. Forget.** *Uninstall* removes the app from your phone. Its dialog has an **"Also remove from Your apps"** checkbox to clear the history entry at the same time. *Forget* only drops the history entry and leaves the installed app untouched.

> [!NOTE]
> When Morphe installs over ADB it records a non-Play installer source, so the Play Store won't silently update (and overwrite) your patched app. This is automatic, there's no setting for it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/documentation/gui/settings.png" width="60%" alt="Settings dialog" style="vertical-align: middle"/>
</p>

A couple of toggles worth expanding on:

- **Auto-start ADB** - when off, Morphe never starts the ADB server and all install/push features are disabled. Turn it on to install patched APKs to your phone from Morphe.
- **Update channel** - *Dev* surfaces pre-releases; *Stable* only stable ones. If you've never chosen, Morphe defaults smartly (Dev when you're running a dev build).
- **Route links to patched app** - when on, every ADB install is followed by routing the app's supported web links to the patched app (the [Link handling](#gui-expert-links) step, run automatically). A nested **Disable stock app's links** option also stops the original app from opening those links – only relevant when a rename patch was used and the stock app is still installed. Both are reversible and need a connected device.

<h4 id="gui-settings-signing">Signing</h4>

This is the GUI face of the `--keystore*` flags. Morphe signs every patched APK so it's installable; by default it uses a single shared keystore in its data folder (see [Where Morphe stores its files](#where-files-stored)) and reuses it across runs – Android only lets you update an installed app with an APK signed by the **same** key, so a stable keystore keeps re-patches installable over old builds.


| Control                   | What it does                                              |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Keystore path +**BROWSE** | Point at your own keystore file                           |
| **RESET**                 | Revert to Morphe's auto-generated default keystore        |
| **KEYSTORE PASSWORD**     | Password for the keystore file (default: empty)           |
| **KEY ALIAS**             | The key entry's alias (default:`Morphe`)                  |
| **KEY PASSWORD**          | The key entry's password (default:`Morphe`)               |
| **VERIFY CREDENTIALS**    | Check the keystore opens with the entered alias/passwords |
| **GENERATE KEYSTORE**     | Create a fresh keystore                                   |

  <img src="images/documentation/gui/keystore-setting.png" width="60%" alt="Keystore signing setting" style="vertical-align: middle"/>
</p>

> [!WARNING]
> If Morphe can't find the configured keystore it warns *"Keystore not found – patching will fail until you restore it, pick another, or reset."* Use **RESET** to fall back to the default, or **BROWSE** to a valid one.

> [!NOTE]
> The signer only loads **BKS** keystores today. Support for pointing at **PKCS12** (`.p12` / `.pfx`) or **JKS** (`.jks`) keystores – auto-converted to BKS, original untouched – is coming in an upcoming release. (Same note as the CLI [`--keystore`](#subcommand-1-patch) flag.)

<h4 id="gui-settings-striplibs">Strip Libs</h4>

Choose which native-library architectures to keep in the patched APK; everything else is stripped, shrinking the file. This sets the default the Patch selection screen reports, and maps to the CLI's `--striplibs`.


| Architecture  | Use it for                             |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| `arm64-v8a`   | ARM 64-bit – most modern phones        |
| `armeabi-v7a` | ARM 32-bit – older phones              |
| `x86_64`      | Intel 64-bit – emulators / Chromebooks |
| `x86`         | Intel 32-bit – legacy emulators        |

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/documentation/gui/strip-libs-setting.png" width="60%" alt="Strip-libs setting" style="vertical-align: middle"/>
</p>

> [!WARNING]
> Only strip architectures your device doesn't use. If you keep just `arm64-v8a` and install on a 32-bit device (or the wrong emulator), the app won't run. When unsure, keep your phone's architecture (almost always `arm64-v8a`).

<h4 id="gui-settings-runtimelogs">Patched app runtime logs</h4>

A debugging aid: capture logcat from a connected device after a patched app crashes or misbehaves, to attach to a bug report. **CLEAR DEVICE LOGS** wipes logcat before you reproduce the issue; **SAVE DEVICE LOGS** then pulls the filtered output to a file. Both require a connected, ADB-authorized device.

> [!NOTE]
> **CLEAR CACHE** asks for confirmation, then removes downloaded `.mpp` files and logs from `morphe-data/`. Nothing irreversible, patches re-download on the next run.

**VIEW LICENSES** opens a searchable browser of the open-source licenses for every third-party library Morphe bundles. Use the search box to filter by name – handy for license compliance, or just to see what's under the hood.

<h3 id="gui-adb">Installing to a device (ADB)</h3>

Morphe can push patched APKs straight to your phone over ADB:

1. Enable **Auto-start ADB** in Settings (off by default).
2. Connect your phone via USB with **USB debugging** enabled, and accept the authorization prompt on the device.
3. The **device indicator** in the top bar shows it; click to pick a device if several are connected.
4. After patching, use **ADB INSTALL** on the Result screen.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/documentation/gui/device-indicator.png" width="60%" alt="Device Indicator" style="vertical-align: middle"/>
</p>

Device states you may see: **READY** (good to go), **UNAUTH** (accept the USB-debugging prompt on the phone), **UNKNOWN** (reconnect / check the cable), and **No devices connected**.

> [!NOTE]
> ADB is entirely optional: it only powers install-to-device. You can always patch without it and install the output APK manually.

<h2 id="cli">CLI</h2>

Prefer the terminal, or automating Morphe in a script or CI? The CLI exposes everything the [GUI](#gui) does – if you just want to patch an app, the GUI above is the easier path.

The CLI suite is an extremely powerful tool.
It has some general flags but is mainly divided into 5 main sub-commands (and they all lived in harmony, until the fire nation attacked. Caught that reference?):

![img.png](images/documentation/cli/cli_overview.png)

<h3 id="general-flags">General flags</h3>

#### `-h`, `--help`:

Shows all the general flags and sub commands available.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar --help
```

#### `-V`, `--version`:

Shows the current version of the morphe-desktop.jar

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar --version
```

<h3 id="subcommand-1-patch">Subcommand 1: <code>patch</code></h3>

This is the most fundamental sub-command. Add the `patch` keyword to run this sub-command.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch [flag/s]
```

Here is a quick lookup for all the flags under this subcommand:


| Flag                           | Description                                                                    |

> [!NOTE]
> The examples used for each flag below only show the usage of that specific flag, but in practice, you'll almost always combine multiple flags together to customize your patching. Here's an example of a more complete command:
>
> ```
> java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp -o your_app_patched.apk --striplibs arm64-v8a --force --continue-on-error -d "change package name" -d "spoof signature" "your_app.apk"
> ```

#### `-p`, `--patches`:

Required: Yes

Default: -

This flag specifies the patch file(s) to apply to your APK. You can pass local `.mpp` file paths or a GitHub or GitLab repository URL, and you can repeat `-p` to combine several bundles in one run (see [Using multiple patch bundles](#using-multiple-bundles) below). When a URL is provided, Morphe automatically downloads the `.mpp` file from the latest release and caches it for future runs.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch --patches patches-*.mpp your_app.apk
```

You can also pass a GitHub or GitLab repo URL:

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch --patches https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches your_app.apk
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch --patches https://gitlab.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches your_app.apk
```

Or a specific release URL:

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch --patches https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches/releases/tag/v1.0.0 your_app.apk
```

<h5 id="using-multiple-bundles">Using multiple patch bundles</h5>

`-p` can be repeated to combine several `.mpp` bundles in a single run:

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches-a.mpp -p patches-b.mpp your_app.apk
```

The **name-based** selection flags (`-e`, `-d`, `-O`) apply to the bundle they follow. Each `-p` starts a new bundle, and the selections after it belong to that bundle until the next `-p`:

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches-a.mpp -e "A patch from bundle A" -p patches-b.mpp -d "A patch from bundle B" your_app.apk
```

**Index-based** selections (`--ei`/`--di`) are the exception. Their numbers refer to the combined list across all supplied bundles, not a single one. Run `list-patches` with the same set of `-p` files to see the combined numbering:

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar list-patches -p patches-a.mpp -p patches-b.mpp
```

Then enable/disable by those combined indices. The index points to a patch no matter which bundle it came from, so its position relative to each `-p` doesn't matter:

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches-a.mpp -p patches-b.mpp --ei 57 --di 12 your_app.apk
```

#### `--prerelease`:

Required: No

Default: `false`

When using a GitHub or GitLab repo URL with `--patches`, fetch the latest dev pre-release instead of the latest stable release.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch --patches https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches --prerelease your_app.apk
```

#### Positional argument (APK file):

Required: Yes

Default: -

The APK file you want to patch. This is passed directly without a flag name, at the end of the command.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp your_app.apk
```

> [!NOTE]
> Morphe also supports `.apkm`, `.xapk`, and `.apks` files (split APK bundles). If you pass one of these, Morphe will automatically merge the splits into a single APK before patching.

#### `-o`, `--out`:

Required: No

Default: a subfolder named after the app, created next to the input APK – `<app>/<app>-Morphe-<appVersion>-patches-<patchesVersion>.apk`

Specify a custom output path for the patched APK.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp -o /path/to/output.apk your_app.apk
```

#### `-e`, `--enable`:

Required: No

Default: -

Enable a specific patch by its exact name. Can be used multiple times to enable several patches.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp -e "Patch name" -e "Another patch" your_app.apk
```

#### `--ei`:

Required: No

Default: -

Enable a specific patch by its index number. Can be used multiple times. Use `list-patches` to find the index of each patch.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --ei 1 --ei 5 your_app.apk
```

#### `-d`, `--disable`:

Required: No

Default: -

Disable a specific patch by its exact name. Can be used multiple times.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp -d "Patch name" your_app.apk
```

#### `--di`:

Required: No

Default: -

Disable a specific patch by its index number. Can be used multiple times. Use `list-patches` to find the index of each patch.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --di 456 your_app.apk
```

> [!TIP]
> You can combine `-e`, `-d`, `--ei`, `--di` and `--exclusive` in the same command.
>
> ```
> java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --exclusive -e "Patch name" --ei 123 your_app.apk
> ```

#### `-O`, `--options`:

Required: No

Default: -

Set option values for patches. Options are key-value pairs passed alongside patch enable flags. To set a value to null, omit the value.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp -e "Patch name" -Okey1=value1 -Okey2=value2 your_app.apk
```

To set an option to null:

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp -e "Patch name" -Okey1 your_app.apk
```

> [!WARNING]
> Option values are typed. Setting a value with the wrong type can cause the patch to fail. Use `list-patches --with-options` to see the expected types.
>
> Common types: `string`, `true`/`false`, `123` (integer), `1.0` (double), `[item1,item2]` (list)

#### `--exclusive`:

Required: No

Default: `false`

Disable all patches except the ones you explicitly enable with `-e` or `--ei`. Useful when you only want a specific set of patches applied.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --exclusive -e "Patch name" your_app.apk
```

#### `-f`, `--force`:

Required: No

Default: `false`

Skip the APK version compatibility check. By default, Morphe will warn you and skip patches that aren't compatible with your APK's version. This flag forces all compatible patches to run regardless.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --force your_app.apk
```

> [!TIP]
> Patches are built for specific app versions.
> If you're using versions that are newer or older than the recommended ones, Morphe will skip all the incompatible patches (which is almost all of them since the version don't match) by default. **Use `--force` to apply them anyway** - they may still work fine, especially on recent versions.

#### `-i`, `--install`:

Required: No

Default: -

Automatically install the patched APK to a connected ADB device after patching.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp -i your_app.apk
```

If no serial is provided, it installs to the first connected device. You can optionally specify a device serial.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp -i SERIAL123 your_app.apk
```

> [!TIP]
> Make sure ADB is working before using this flag:
>
> ```
> adb shell exit
> ```

#### `--mount`:

Required: No

Default: `false`

Install the patched APK by mounting it on top of the original app. Requires root access and the original app to be installed on the device.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp -i --mount your_app.apk
```

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have root permissions:
>
> ```
> adb shell su -c exit
> ```

#### `--keystore`:

Required: No

Default: the shared `morphe-data/morphe.keystore` (see [Where Morphe stores its files](#where-files-stored))

Path to a keystore file containing a private key and certificate pair to sign the patched APK with. If not specified, Morphe uses a single shared keystore in its data folder – auto-creating it on the first run and reusing it afterwards. Reusing one keystore is intentional: Android only lets you update an installed app with an APK signed by the **same** key, so a stable keystore means you can re-patch and reinstall over a previous build.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --keystore /path/to/keystore.bks your_app.apk
```

> [!NOTE]
> The patcher signs using **BKS** keystores. If you point `--keystore` at a **PKCS12** (`.p12`/`.pfx`) or **JKS** (`.jks`) file, Morphe auto-detects the format from the file's contents (not its extension) and converts a BKS copy to sign with. Your original keystore file is never modified.

#### `--keystore-password`:

Required: No

Default: empty (no password)

Password to open the **keystore file** itself. Different from the key *entry* password (`--keystore-entry-password`). Morphe's auto-generated default keystore has an empty store password, so you typically only need this flag when supplying your own keystore that was created with one.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --keystore keystore.jks --keystore-password "mypassword" your_app.apk
```

> [!NOTE]
> The CLI and the Morphe Manager Android app share the same keystore defaults (alias `"Morphe"`, password `"Morphe"`), so a keystore generated by either tool works in the other without extra flags.

#### `--keystore-entry-alias`:

Required: No

Default: `"Morphe"`

The alias of the private key entry inside the keystore.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --keystore keystore.jks --keystore-entry-alias "my-alias" your_app.apk
```

#### `--keystore-entry-password`:

Required: No

Default: `"Morphe"`

Password for the specific keystore entry.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --keystore keystore.jks --keystore-entry-password "mypassword" your_app.apk
```

#### `--signer`:

Required: No

Default: `"Morphe"`

The name of the signer embedded in the APK signature.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --signer "My Signer" your_app.apk
```

#### `--unsigned`:

Required: No

Default: `false`

Skip signing the patched APK entirely. The output APK will not be signed and cannot be installed directly on a device without signing it separately.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --unsigned your_app.apk
```

#### `-t`, `--temporary-files-path`:

Required: No

Default: `morphe-data/tmp/` next to the JAR (falls back to `~/morphe/tmp/`)

Path to a directory where Morphe stores temporary files during patching.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp -t /tmp/morphe-temp your_app.apk
```

#### `--disable-purge`:

Required: No

Default: `false`

By default, this run's scratch files are deleted once patching finishes. Pass this flag to keep them instead — useful for debugging a failed patch. Does not affect cached patches, other sessions, or config.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --disable-purge your_app.apk
```

#### `--striplibs`:

Required: No

Default: -

Comma-separated list of native library architectures to **keep**. All other architectures will be stripped from the APK, reducing file size.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --striplibs arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a your_app.apk
```

#### `--bytecode-mode`:

Required: No

Default: `STRIP_FAST`

Controls how Morphe processes the APK's bytecode (DEX) during patching. Trade-off between speed, output size, and safety.


| Value        | Description                                                                                                                  |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FULL`       | Rebuilds and includes all bytecode. Largest output, slowest, safest - use if you hit runtime issues with the stripped modes. |
| `STRIP_SAFE` | Strips bytecode that is provably unused, while keeping anything reachable via reflection or dynamic loading.                 |
| `STRIP_FAST` | Default. Aggressively strips unused bytecode for the smallest, fastest build. May break apps that rely on reflection.        |

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --bytecode-mode FULL your_app.apk
```

> [!TIP]
> If a patched app crashes at startup or has odd missing-class errors, switch to `STRIP_SAFE` or `FULL` and see if it fixes things.

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows, Morphe currently forces bytecode mode to `FULL` regardless of what you pass to this flag (workaround for a platform-specific issue). The flag still works as expected on macOS and Linux.

#### `--verify-with-sdk`:

Required: No

Default: - (verification is skipped)

Verify the patched DEX and APK files using a local Android SDK after patching. Helpful for catching corrupt output before installing on a device. Pass a path to your SDK install directory, or pass the flag with no value to let Morphe auto-discover one.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --verify-with-sdk /path/to/android-sdk your_app.apk
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --verify-with-sdk your_app.apk
```

> [!NOTE]
> When you pass `--verify-with-sdk` without a path, Morphe resolves the SDK in this order:
>
> 1. `$ANDROID_HOME`
> 2. `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`
> 3. OS-default install location:
>    - macOS: `~/Library/Android/sdk`
>    - Windows: `~/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk`
>    - Linux: `~/Android/Sdk`
>
> If none of those resolve to a real SDK, Morphe errors out with a hint to either set one of the env vars or supply a path explicitly.

#### `--continue-on-error`:

Required: No

Default: `false`

By default, patching stops on the first patch failure. This flag lets Morphe continue applying the remaining patches even if one fails.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --continue-on-error your_app.apk
```

#### `--options-file`:

Required: No

Default: -

Path to a JSON file that controls which patches are enabled/disabled and their option values. Generate one using the `options-create` subcommand.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --options-file options.json your_app.apk
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the file you specify doesn't exist yet, Morphe will automatically generate one with default values at that path and use it for the current patch. This means you can skip `options-create` entirely - just pass a path to a non-existent file and Morphe will create it for you.

> [!TIP]
> The options file is great for repeatable patching. Generate it once (either with `options-create` or by letting `--options-file` auto-generate it), tweak it, and reuse it every time you patch.

#### `--options-update`:

Required: No

Default: `false`

Automatically update the options JSON file after patching to reflect the current patches. Without this flag, the file is left unchanged. New patches get added, removed patches get cleaned up.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --options-file options.json --options-update your_app.apk
```

#### `-r`, `--result-file`:

Required: No

Default: -

Path to save a JSON file containing the patching result. The file records:

- the package name and version of the patched app
- whether patching succeeded overall
- the result of each patching step
- the list of applied patches
- the list of failed patches, with their error details

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp -r result.json your_app.apk
```

---

<h3 id="subcommand-2-list-patches">Subcommand 2: <code>list-patches</code></h3>

Lists all available patches from the supplied MPP files. Useful for finding patch names, indices, compatible packages, and options before patching.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar list-patches --patches patches.mpp [flag/s]
```

<h3 id="subcommand-4-options-create">Subcommand 4: <code>options-create</code></h3>

Creates or updates an options JSON file for controlling which patches are enabled/disabled and their option values. The generated file can be passed to the `patch` subcommand with `--options-file`.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar options-create [flag/s]
```

Here is a quick lookup for all the flags under this subcommand:


| Flag                           | Description                                            |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `-p`, `--patches`              | Paths to .mpp files or GitHub or GitLab repo URLs      |
| `--prerelease`                 | Fetch latest dev pre-release instead of stable release |
| `-o`, `--out`                  | Path to the output JSON file                           |
| `-f`, `--filter-package-name`  | Filter patches by package name                         |

#### `-p`, `--patches`:

Required: Yes

Default: -

One or more paths to .mpp patch files or GitHub or GitLab repository URLs to generate options from. When a URL is provided, Morphe downloads the .mpp file and caches it for future runs.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar options-create -p patches.mpp -o options.json
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar options-create -p https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches -o options.json
```

#### `--prerelease`:

Required: No

Default: `false`

When using a GitHub or GitLab repo URL with `--patches`, fetch the latest dev pre-release instead of the latest stable release.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar options-create -p https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches --prerelease -o options.json
```

#### `-o`, `--out`:

Required: Yes

Default: -

Path to the output JSON file. If the file already exists, Morphe will merge the current patches into it - preserving your existing settings, adding new patches, and removing patches that no longer exist.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar options-create -p patches.mpp -o options.json
```

> [!TIP]
> Run this command again after updating your .mpp file to keep your options file in sync. Existing settings are preserved.

#### `-f`, `--filter-package-name`:

Required: No

Default: -

Only include patches compatible with the specified package name in the generated options file.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar options-create -p patches.mpp -o options.json -f com.google.android.youtube
```

#### Options JSON Workflow

The options JSON file lets you save your patch preferences and reuse them across multiple patching sessions. Here's the typical workflow:

**Step 1: Generate the options file**

Use `options-create` to generate a JSON file with all available patches and their default settings:

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar options-create -p patches.mpp -o options.json
```

**Step 2: Edit the file**

Open `options.json` in any text editor. You can enable/disable patches and set option values. The file contains a list of patch bundles, each with patch entries that look like:

```json
{
  "patchName": {
    "enabled": true,
    "options": {
      "optionKey": "optionValue"
    }
  }
}
```

Set `"enabled": false` to disable a patch, or change option values as needed.

**Step 3: Patch using the options file**

Pass your customized options file to the `patch` command:

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --options-file options.json your_app.apk
```

**Step 4: Keep the file in sync (optional)**

When you update your .mpp file to a newer version, patches may be added or removed. You have two ways to sync:

- Re-run `options-create` - this merges new patches in while preserving your existing settings:

  ```
  java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar options-create -p patches.mpp -o options.json
  ```
- Use `--options-update` during patching - this auto-updates the file after patching:

  ```
  java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp --options-file options.json --options-update your_app.apk
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> CLI flags (`-e`, `-d`, `--ei`, `--di`, `-O`) always take precedence over the options file. If you enable a patch via CLI that the options file disables, the CLI wins. Morphe will log when this happens.

> [!TIP]
> You can also skip `options-create` entirely. If you pass `--options-file` with a path that doesn't exist yet, Morphe will auto-generate the file with defaults for you.

<h3 id="subcommand-5-utility">Subcommand 5: <code>utility</code></h3>

Parent command for utility operations. It allows for things like manually installing or uninstalling apps via ADB, clearing the cache directory, etc. Has three sub-subcommands: `install`, `uninstall`, and `clear-cache`.

<h4 id="utility-install"><code>utility install</code></h4>

Manually install an APK file to one or more ADB-connected devices.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar utility install [flag/s] [device-serial...]
```


| Flag               | Description                                                               |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-a`, `--apk`      | APK file to install                                                       |
| `-m`, `--mount`    | Mount over an existing app (requires package name and root)               |
| `--route-links`    | After installing, route the app's supported web links to it ("open with") |
| `--disable-stock`  | With`--route-links`: also stop the named stock package from handling them |
| *(positional arg)* | ADB device serial(s)                                                      |

##### `-a`, `--apk`:

Required: Yes

Default: -

Path to the APK file you want to install.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar utility install -a patched_app.apk
```

##### `-m`, `--mount`:

Required: No

Default: -

Mount the APK on top of an existing app instead of a regular install. Pass the package name of the app to mount over. Requires root access.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar utility install -a patched_app.apk -m com.google.android.youtube
```

##### `--route-links`:

Required: No

Default: -

After installing, route the app's supported web links to it ("open with"), so they open in the patched app instead of the browser or the stock app. The package name is read from the APK, so no value is needed.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar utility install -a patched_app.apk --route-links
```

##### `--disable-stock`:

Required: No

Default: -

Use with `--route-links`. Also stops the named stock package from handling those links – needed when a rename patch was applied and the original app is still installed.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar utility install -a patched_youtube.apk --route-links --disable-stock com.google.android.youtube
```

##### Positional argument (device serials):

Required: No

Default: First connected device

One or more ADB device serials to install to. If not provided, installs to the first connected device.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar utility install -a patched_app.apk SERIAL1 SERIAL2
```

---

<h4 id="utility-uninstall"><code>utility uninstall</code></h4>

Manually uninstall a patched app from one or more ADB-connected devices.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar utility uninstall [flag/s] [device-serial...]

##### `-p`, `--package-name`:

Required: Yes

Default: -

The package name of the app to uninstall.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar utility uninstall -p com.google.android.youtube
```

##### `-u`, `--unmount`:

Required: No

Default: `false`

If the app was installed by mounting (using `--mount`), use this flag to unmount it instead of a regular uninstall.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar utility uninstall -p com.google.android.youtube --unmount
```

##### Positional argument (device serials):

Required: No

Default: First connected device

One or more ADB device serials to uninstall from. If not provided, uninstalls from the first connected device.

```

##### `--info`:

Required: No

Default: `false`

Show how much was cleared from each location (patches, logs, temp) with file counts and the total space freed, instead of just a confirmation line.

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar utility clear-cache --info
```

<h3 id="value-types-reference">Value Types Reference</h3>

When setting patch options with `-O` or in an options JSON file, values are typed. Using the wrong type can cause a patch to fail. Here are the supported types and how to format them:


| Type                  | Example                | Notes                             |
|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| String                | `string`               | Plain text                        |
| Boolean               | `true`, `false`        |                                   |
| Integer               | `123`                  | Whole numbers                     |
| Double                | `1.0`                  | Decimal numbers                   |
| Float                 | `1.0f`                 | Decimal with`f` suffix            |
| Long                  | `1234567890`, `1L`     | Large numbers, optional`L` suffix |
| List                  | `[item1,item2,item3]`  | Comma-separated, no spaces        |
| List (mixed types)    | `[item1,123,true,1.0]` | Items are parsed by their type    |
| Empty list (any type) | `[]`                   |                                   |
| Typed empty list      | `int[]`                | Empty list of a specific type     |
| Nested empty list     | `[int[]]`              |                                   |
| List with null/empty  | `[null,'','"]`         |                                   |

**Escaping:**

Quotes and commas inside strings need to be escaped with `\`:

- `\"` - escaped double quote
- `\'` - escaped single quote
- `\,` - escaped comma (treated as part of the string, not a list separator)

List items are parsed recursively, so escaping works inside lists too:


| What you want       | How to write it       |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Integer as a string | `[\'123\']`           |
| Boolean as a string | `[\'true\']`          |
| List as a string    | `[\'[item1,item2]\']` |
| Null as a string    | `[\'null\']`          |

**Example command:**

```
java -jar morphe-desktop-*-all.jar patch -p patches.mpp -e "Patch name" -OstringKey=\'1\' your_app.apk
```

This sets `stringKey` to the string `"1"` instead of the integer `1`.


<h2 id="building">🔨️ Building</h2>

Want to build Morphe Desktop from source instead of grabbing a release? Here's how.

**Requirements:** Java Development Kit 17 (e.g. [Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#zulu) or [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/archive/)).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:MorpheApp/morphe-desktop.git
   cd morphe-desktop
   ```

2. Build it:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> If the build fails with an authentication error, you need to authenticate to GitHub Packages. Create a personal access token with the `read:packages` scope [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=read:packages&description=Morphe), then add it to `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:
>
> ```properties
> gpr.user = your-github-username
> gpr.key = your-token
> ```

When the build finishes, the runnable JAR is at `build/libs/morphe-desktop-<version>-all.jar`.
