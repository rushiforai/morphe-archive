/**
 * Provider-agnostic interface for fetching patch releases from a remote
 * source (GitHub, GitLab, …). Implementations own:
 *   - API endpoint construction
 *   - HTTP headers and response shape normalization
 *   - Asset download mechanics (redirects, byte streaming)
 *
 * Implementations do NOT own:
 *   - In-memory or disk caching policy — that's a caller concern
 *   - Multi-source orchestration
 *   - UI / progress reporting style
 *
 * This is the engine layer's heart for remote patches. Both the GUI's
 * PatchRepository and the CLI's PatchFileResolver call into a
 * RemotePatchSource to do the real work, while owning their own caching
 * and surface-specific concerns on top.
