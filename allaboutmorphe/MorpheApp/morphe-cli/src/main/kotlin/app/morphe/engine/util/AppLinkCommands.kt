/**
 * Builds the `pm` shell command lines that route web links ("open with") to a
 * patched app and, optionally, stop the stock app from grabbing those same
 * links.
 *
 * Pure argv construction only — no process execution. Each frontend runs these
 * through its own adb path (the GUI's `AdbManager`, the CLI's installer), so the
 * "what commands to run" decision lives in one tested place while "how to exec"
 * stays per-frontend.
 *
 * Each returned entry is one `adb shell` invocation's arguments (i.e. everything
 * after `adb -s <serial> shell`). Run them in order.
 *
 * Background: the patched app's web intent filters are NOT `autoVerify`, so
 * Android's domain-verification commands no-op on them. The *user-selection*
 * state, however, can be set for any host the app declares — that's the route
 * used here (and the one Morphe's own docs prescribe).
