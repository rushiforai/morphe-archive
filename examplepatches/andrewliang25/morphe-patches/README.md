| :---: |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Disable LINE Premium](#disable-line-premium) | Hides all LINE Yahoo Premium (LYP) surfaces — upsells, badges, the Premium settings page, and subscribe/manage flows. Premium chat backup falls back to the ordinary chat-history backup. Doesn't unlock anything (premium is server-enforced). |  |
| [Disable VOOM](#disable-voom) | Neutralizes VOOM entry points — deep links, shares, and notifications do nothing and the standalone VOOM feed closes on open. Messaging and other tabs are unaffected. |  |
| [Fix chat backup sign-in via GmsCore](#fix-chat-backup-sign-in-via-gmscore) | Routes chat-history backup's Google account picker and Drive token through GmsCore, so backup and restore work on re-signed builds. Requires MicroG-RE. Doesn't affect Google account login. Root Mount install does not need this patch. |  |
| [Fix push notifications](#fix-push-notifications) | Restores push notifications on re-signed builds when LINE is fully closed. Root Mount install does not need this patch. |  |
| [Hide Events button](#hide-events-button) | Removes the "Events" row from a chat room's slide-out menu. (Events is a separate feature from LINE Calendar — it opens a server-hosted page.) |  |
| [Hide Home modules](#hide-home-modules) | Hides Home-tab clutter modules: the recommended stickers/content section, the real-time hot-topics (即時夯話題) block, and Home feed ads. |  |
| [Hide LINE GIFT button](#hide-line-gift-button) | Removes the LINE GIFT tile from a chat room's + attach menu. |  |
| [Hide LINE TODAY tab](#hide-line-today-tab) | Removes the LINE TODAY (News) tab from the main bottom navigation, in both the news-tab and news-row layouts. |  |
| [Hide Shopping tab](#hide-shopping-tab) | Removes the Shopping tab from the main bottom navigation, covering both the Japan (Shopping / ショッピング) and Taiwan (Discover / 逛逛) variants. |  |
| [Hide Transfer button](#hide-transfer-button) | Removes the Transfer (LINE Pay) tile from a chat room's + attach menu. |  |
| [Hide VOOM tab](#hide-voom-tab) | Removes the VOOM (formerly Timeline) tab from the main bottom navigation. |  |
| [Hide Wallet tab](#hide-wallet-tab) | Removes the Wallet (LINE Pay) tab from the main bottom navigation, in both the normal and mini-tab layouts. |  |
| [Hide ad views](#hide-ad-views) | Hides LINE display ad views — the LINE Ads SDK containers across the app, the chat-list Smart Channel banner, and Google AdManager ads. |  |
| [Hide attach menu extra tools](#hide-attach-menu-extra-tools) | Removes all the server-provided extra tools from a chat room's + attach menu (Poll, Reservation, Schedule, Ladder shuffle, and any others). The built-in tiles (camera, gallery, files, contact, etc.) are unaffected. |  |
| [Hide calendar buttons](#hide-calendar-buttons) | Removes every LINE Calendar button inside the messenger: the one in the Chats-tab header, and the four inside a chat room — the top toolbar, the + attach menu, the slide-out chat menu, and the message long-press menu. |  |
| [Hide community button](#hide-community-button) | Removes the community (OpenChat) button from the top of the Chats tab header. |  |
| [Hide premium unsend upsells](#hide-premium-unsend-upsells) | Removes the LYP premium-unsend upsells that survive "Disable LINE Premium": the "Unsend discreetly" button, the post-unsend promo link, and the expired-window unsend upsell. Ordinary unsend still works. |  |
| [Keep chats unread](#keep-chats-unread) | Opening a 1:1 or group chat no longer marks it read — it stays unread and no read receipt is sent. Manually using "Mark as read" / "Mark all as read" still marks the chat read and sends the receipt as normal. |  |
| [Keep unsent messages](#keep-unsent-messages) | Keeps messages that were unsent in 1:1 and group chats on your device instead of destroying them, and shows the usual "unsent a message" notice directly below the message it kept. Doesn't apply to OpenChat. |  |
| [Open links in external browser](#open-links-in-external-browser) | Opens tapped web links (http/https) in your default browser instead of LINE's in-app browser. LIFF mini-apps and LINE deep links are unaffected. |  |
| [Redirect LINE Pay](#redirect-line-pay) | Forwards LINE Pay flows to the standalone LINE Pay app instead of running them in-app, so the device-integrity check that fails on a re-signed build never runs. Messaging is unaffected. |  |
| [Remove banner ads](#remove-banner-ads) | Stops LINE from loading Smart Channel banner ads (neutralizes the getBanners and getPrefetchableBanners responses). |  |

### 🛠️ Building

To build Andrew's Patches, obey the instructions in the
[Morphe documentation](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-documentation).

## ⚠️ Known limitations

### LINE: Google account sign-in fails (re-signed builds)

**What:** On a patched **LINE** build, you cannot sign in with a Google account or link one.

**Why:** Google accepts an account only for an OAuth client that is registered under LINE's package
name **and** its original signing certificate. A re-signed build changes that certificate, so no
client matches. LINE asks Android's Credential Manager for the account, so the *system* picks
Google Play Services. No patch can change this ([details](docs/line-patch-map.md)).

**Workaround:** install with **Root Mount**, which keeps LINE's original signature. Do not use the
**Standard** install.

This limitation does not affect chat-history backup. The *Fix chat backup sign-in via GmsCore*
patch restores it through [MicroG-RE](https://github.com/MorpheApp/MicroG-RE).
