| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Disable LINE Premium](#disable-line-premium) | Hides all LINE Yahoo Premium (LYP) surfaces — upsells, badges, the Premium settings page, and subscribe/manage flows. Doesn't unlock anything (premium is server-enforced). |  |
| [Disable VOOM](#disable-voom) | Neutralizes VOOM entry points — deep links, shares, and notifications do nothing and the standalone VOOM feed closes on open. Messaging and other tabs are unaffected. |  |
| [Fix push notifications](#fix-push-notifications) | Restores push notifications on re-signed builds when LINE is fully closed. Root Mount install does not need this patch. |  |
| [Hide Events button](#hide-events-button) | Removes the "Events" row from a chat room's slide-out menu. (Events is a separate feature from LINE Calendar — it opens a server-hosted page.) |  |
| [Hide Home modules](#hide-home-modules) | Hides Home-tab clutter modules: the recommended stickers/content section, the real-time hot-topics (即時夯話題) block, and Home feed ads. |  |
| [Hide LINE GIFT button](#hide-line-gift-button) | Removes the LINE GIFT tile from a chat room's + attach menu. |  |
| [Hide LINE TODAY tab](#hide-line-today-tab) | Removes the LINE TODAY (News) tab from the main bottom navigation, in both the news-tab and news-row layouts. |  |
| [Hide Transfer button](#hide-transfer-button) | Removes the Transfer (LINE Pay) tile from a chat room's + attach menu. |  |
| [Hide VOOM tab](#hide-voom-tab) | Removes the VOOM (formerly Timeline) tab from the main bottom navigation. |  |
| [Hide Wallet tab](#hide-wallet-tab) | Removes the Wallet (LINE Pay) tab from the main bottom navigation, in both the normal and mini-tab layouts. |  |
| [Hide ad views](#hide-ad-views) | Hides LINE display ad views — the LINE Ads SDK containers across the app, the chat-list Smart Channel banner, and Google AdManager ads. |  |
| [Hide attach menu extra tools](#hide-attach-menu-extra-tools) | Removes all the server-provided extra tools from a chat room's + attach menu (Poll, Reservation, Schedule, Ladder shuffle, and any others). The built-in tiles (camera, gallery, files, contact, etc.) are unaffected. |  |
| [Hide calendar buttons](#hide-calendar-buttons) | Removes every LINE Calendar button inside the messenger: the one in the Chats-tab header, and the four inside a chat room — the top toolbar, the + attach menu, the slide-out chat menu, and the message long-press menu. |  |
| [Hide community button](#hide-community-button) | Removes the community (OpenChat) button from the top of the Chats tab header. |  |
| [Hide premium unsend upsells](#hide-premium-unsend-upsells) | Removes the LYP premium-unsend upsells that survive "Disable LINE Premium": the "Unsend discreetly" button, the post-unsend promo link, and the expired-window unsend upsell. Ordinary unsend still works. |  |
| [Keep chats unread](#keep-chats-unread) | Opening a 1:1 or group chat no longer marks it read — it stays unread and no read receipt is sent. Manually using "Mark as read" / "Mark all as read" still marks the chat read and sends the receipt as normal. |  |
| [Open links in external browser](#open-links-in-external-browser) | Opens tapped web links (http/https) in your default browser instead of LINE's in-app browser. LIFF mini-apps and LINE deep links are unaffected. |  |
| [Redirect LINE Pay](#redirect-line-pay) | Forwards LINE Pay flows to the standalone LINE Pay app instead of running them in-app, so the device-integrity check that fails on a re-signed build never runs. Messaging is unaffected. |  |
| [Remove banner ads](#remove-banner-ads) | Stops LINE from loading Smart Channel banner ads (neutralizes the getBanners and getPrefetchableBanners responses). |  |

### 🛠️ Building

To build Andrew's Patches,
you can follow the [Morphe documentation](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-documentation).

## ⚠️ Known limitations

### Google account sign-in fails (chat-history backup/restore)

**What:** On a patched build, signing in with a Google account to back up or restore chat
history fails at the account-selection step, so Drive-based chat history backup/restore is
unavailable.

**Why:** LINE stores chat history in Google Drive and gates it behind Google Sign-In with
the `drive.appdata` scope. Google grants that access only to an OAuth client registered for
LINE's **package name + original signing certificate**. Re-signing the APK changes the
certificate, so Google Play Services rejects the sign-in (`DEVELOPER_ERROR`, status code 10)
and no Drive token is issued. Unlike LINE's push (FCM) registration, this check runs inside
Google Play Services rather than in LINE's own code, so it can't be fixed from the patch side.

**Workaround:** install with **Root Mount** (which keeps LINE's original signature) instead
of **Standard** install (which re-signs the APK).
