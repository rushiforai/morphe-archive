/**
 * The handler behind a download button added to the reel sidebar.
 *
 * <p>The sidebar builds each of its buttons through one factory of the app, and that factory takes
 * its handlers as {@code Function1}. The reference bundle had no extension of its own, so it had to
 * borrow one of the app's multiplexed lambdas and pick unused case numbers inside it. The module
 * here already carries the Kotlin standard library, so this implements {@code Function1} directly
 * and is passed straight in. Nothing of the app is modified to hold it.
 *
 * <p>The object carries the player of the item that the button belongs to, so the file saved is
 * always the reel on the screen. The app prepares the reels that come next, so a handler that
 * reads a shared place instead saves the wrong one.
 *
 * <h2>Slots</h2>
 *
 * <p>The factory takes several handlers and only one of them is the tap. Which one is not written
 * anywhere, and the render of the button cannot settle it either, so a run answered it. Every slot
 * got one of these with its own number, and the events they received named them. The touch
 * slot fires twice per press with a {@code MotionEvent}. A visibility slot fires on its own. One
 * slot fires once per press with an event that carries nothing but the {@code View}. That last one
 * is the tap, and it is the only slot that saves. The others are kept rather than left null. The
 * factory is not documented to accept null, and a silent handler costs nothing.
