 *
 * That string is not globally unique — it also appears in the worker helper
 * `com.linecorp.line.premium.backup.impl.common.worker.a.a()V` — so the `(String, Z)Unit`
 * signature is pinned to disambiguate; the two enclosing methods share nothing else.
 *
 * We do NOT patch `h()`; we only need its `definingClass` to reach the premium-backup
 * availability gate `ic4.d.j()` (see the patch). `vc4.k0`, `vc4.a0` and `ic4.d` are all
 * obfuscated and drift between versions, so none of them is hardcoded.
