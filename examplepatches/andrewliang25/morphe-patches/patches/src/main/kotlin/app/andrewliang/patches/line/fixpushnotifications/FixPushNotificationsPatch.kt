/**
 * LINE's ORIGINAL signing-certificate SHA-1 (uppercase hex, no separators) — the value the
 * unpatched app reports in `X-Android-Cert` and which LINE's Firebase API key is allow-listed
 * against.
 *
 * `base.apk` (26.11.0) is signed with APK Signature Scheme v3.1 key rotation, so it carries two
 * certificates: the lineage-ROOT / original key (Android SDK 24–32) and a rotated key (SDK
 * 33+). `rl.a.a` reads the cert via the deprecated `GET_SIGNATURES`, which for a rotated app
 * returns the ORIGINAL (lineage-root) certificate for backward compatibility — so this is the
 * SDK 24–32 signer.
 *
 * If a re-signed build still shows `FisError: "BAD CONFIG"` after applying this patch, the
 * device may be reporting the rotated signer instead; swap in the SDK 33+ cert:
 * `6A2927D945AEA6571E1DA5566802F25045D367BD`.
