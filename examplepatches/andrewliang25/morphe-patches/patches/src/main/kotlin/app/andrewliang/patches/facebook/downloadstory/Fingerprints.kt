 * The action behind the save item. The analytics event that it reports is what finds it.

 * The event name is in three methods. One of the other two is a string table, which returns a
 * `String`. The second is the orchestrator further down the chain, which takes eight parameters.
 * Only this method is a `void` with one parameter.
 *
 * The patch does not edit this method. It reads the class of the action from it. That class is what
 * the menu builder creates, and thus what identifies the builder without a name that Redex moves.
