# LINE patch map & findings

Reference notes for authoring LINE (`jp.naver.line.android`) patches, distilled from decompiling
**LINE 26.11.0** (the version pinned in `app/andrewliang/patches/shared/Constants.kt`).

> ⚠️ **Obfuscation drift.** Names like `hg1.d`, `az0.q`, `d00.z`, `ne1.y0$c`, `fg1.a$b`, `r51.a`
> are R8-obfuscated and **change between LINE versions**. The concepts and anchoring strategies are
> durable; re-confirm every descriptor against the decompiled smali on a version bump. Prefer
> anchors obfuscation cannot touch: Kotlin **enum-constant names** (`CALENDAR`, `GIFT`), **string
> literals**, **resource ids**.

## Local build & verify without GitHub Packages credentials

Building normally needs a PAT for `maven.pkg.github.com/MorpheApp/registry`. If the artifacts are
already in the Gradle cache you can work **fully offline** — the `app.morphe.patches` settings
plugin only needs the credential values to be *non-null*, not valid, when nothing is fetched:

```bash
# Compile + build the bundle offline (dummy creds satisfy the non-null credential block)
rm -rf patches/build/libs
./gradlew :patches:buildAndroid --offline --no-daemon -Pgpr.user=dummy -Pgpr.key=dummy

# List patches in the built bundle (confirm name/description/registration)
java -jar work/morphe-desktop-*.jar list-patches --patches patches/build/libs/patches-*.mpp

# Apply ONE patch exclusively against the real APK (fingerprints resolve here, not at build time)
java -jar work/morphe-desktop-*.jar patch \
  -p patches/build/libs/patches-*.mpp \
  --exclusive -e "<patch name>" \
  -o work/out.apk -t "$TMPDIR/scratch" \
  work/apkm-extract/base.apk
```

The apply log's `Writing N new classes` is **the number of classes your patch modified** — a fast
sanity check (Calendar touches 5, attach-tools 1).

**Disassembling the result.** No `baksmali` CLI ships: the Morphe/apktool jars carry only the smali
*assembler* and a shrunk `baksmali` library. `apktool d` works but is slow. Fast path — STRIP_FAST
(the default) writes every modified class into a fresh small `classes.dex`, so unzip just that and
read it with **dexlib2** (Gradle cache jar `smali-dexlib2-*.jar`):

```java
// javac -cp smali-dexlib2-*.jar:smali-util-*.jar Dump.java && java -cp .:...:... Dump
var dex = DexBackedDexFile.fromInputStream(Opcodes.getDefault(),
              new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("classes.dex")));
for (ClassDef c : dex.getClasses())
    for (Method m : c.getMethods()) { /* inspect m.getImplementation().getInstructions() */ }
```

Cast instructions to `OneRegisterInstruction` / `TwoRegisterInstruction` /
`NarrowLiteralInstruction` / `ReferenceInstruction` to print registers, literals, and field/method
references.

## Chat "+" attach menu

Built by **`gg1.e.r(boolean)`** (`smali_classes9/gg1/e.smali`; jadx `gg1/e.java`), the RecyclerView
adapter for the attach grid (item layout `R.layout.chat_ui_attach_grid_item`). It concatenates two
kinds of items into one `[Lhg1/a;` array, then keeps each only if `((hg1.a) item).f(...)` returns
true:

1. **Static local tiles** — one `hg1.r` subclass each, constructed inline in `gg1.e.r()`.
2. **Server-driven services** — a runtime-fetched list (`r11.d.c()` → `List<r51.a>`); each entry
   becomes one `hg1.d` (the single shared "ChatAppButtonType" class), built in the loop at
   `gg1/e.smali:827`. If the list is not cached yet it returns `[]` and kicks off an async fetch,
   then re-renders.

### Item gates (`hg1.r` / `hg1.a`)

`hg1.r.f(Lgi1/b;Lfg1/a;Lhg1/a$a;)Z` is the visibility gate. It shows an item only when: the chat
type is in the item's allowed set **AND** `j(Lgi1/b;)Z` (per-type availability) **AND** `k(...)`
**AND** `l(...)` all pass. So **forcing `j()` false hides a static tile**. Forcing `f()` false hides
whatever class owns that `f()`.

### Static tiles (LINE 26.11.0)

| Tile (label) | Class | ctor type constant (`Lfg1/a$b;->…`) | `j()` availability |
|---|---|---|---|
| Calendar (`line_calendar_plusmenu_calendar`) | `hg1.b` | `CALENDAR` | `return true` |
| Message scheduler (`chat_plusmenu_button_scheduledmessages`) | `hg1.s` | `SCHEDULED_MESSAGE` | schedule-a-message composer |
| Transfer / LINE Pay (`chathistory_attach_dialog_label_select_linepay`) | `hg1.k` | `PAY` | `contains(dl3.a.PAY)` |
| LINE GIFT (`chathistory_attach_dialog_label_giftshop`) | `hg1.h` | `GIFT` | `contains(dl3.a.GIFT)` |
| Files `hg1.g`, Contact `hg1.f`, Location `hg1.m`, Voice `hg1.t`, Keep `hg1.i`, PayPay `hg1.p`, Live talk `hg1.l`, LINE MUSIC `hg1.n` | — | (their own) | — |

**To hide one static tile** (used by "Hide Transfer button", "Hide LINE GIFT button" and the Calendar
`+` tile): anchor its ctor on the **unique read of its `fg1.a$b` type constant** — each constant is read
in that one ctor only, and pinning the ctor's parameter list excludes the enum's `<clinit>` `sput` —
then `mutableClassDefBy(fp.method.definingClass)`, select `j(Lgi1/b;)Z` by descriptor, and prepend
`const/4 p0, 0x0` / `return p0`.

### Server-driven services — Poll, Reservation, Schedule, Ladder shuffle, …

These come from the server (category `e38.a.EnumC2123a.MORE`, mapped `e38.a`→`r51.a` in `r11.e.c()`).
`r51.a` (ChatAppViewData) = `{id, name, iconUrl, url, showNewBadge, availableChatTypes}` — labels,
icons and destinations all come from the server payload, **not** from local resources. (The
`chathistory_attach_dialog_label_poll/schedule/ladder_shuffle/reservation` strings still exist in
`res/` but are **dead** — unreferenced by any smali.)

- **Hide the whole category (stable):** every service is an `hg1.d`, built *only* in `gg1.e`, so forcing
  **`hg1.d.f(Lgi1/b;Lfg1/a;Lhg1/a$a;)Z`** to `return false` drops them all at once with no dependency on
  the drifting server payload. This is **"Hide attach menu extra tools"**. Anchor: `hg1.d.f` is the only
  `f(...)Z` reading `Lr51/a;->f` (its `availableChatTypes` set), which separates it from the sibling
  `f()` overrides in `hg1.a`/`hg1.r`.
- **Hide one service (fragile — avoid):** a single service is identifiable only by its LINE service
  **channel id** (Schedule/create-event = `"1655112642"` real / `"1651805621"` beta, in enum
  `jg1.a$a.SCHEDULE` → `et1.s.g.SCHEDULE`). Channel ids are server-assigned and can change, so such a
  patch cannot be pinned to an APK version. Prefer the category gate.

## LINE Calendar vs Events vs Message scheduler — three distinct features

Easy to conflate. They are separate features with separate entry points, gates, and destinations.

**Calendar** (native LINE Calendar; strings `line_calendar_*`; feature gate interface `jp0.d`, impl
`pp0.g`). Five in-messenger entry points, all removed by **"Hide calendar buttons"**:

| Surface | Class / anchor | Hide technique |
|---|---|---|
| Chats-tab header button | `az0.q.CALENDAR` added to list `fb8.b` in `gw1.f.<init>` | remove the `sget CALENDAR` + following `add(...)` pair |
| Chat-room top toolbar | `ed1.d0.a`, `ed1.g1.CALENDAR_BUTTON` (two add-sites) via `ed1.s1.g(...)` | remove both `sget CALENDAR_BUTTON` + `g(...)` pairs |
| `+` attach tile | `hg1.b` (see attach-menu section) | force `j()` false |
| Slide-out chat-menu "Calendar" row | `d00.o` (holds `f11.b`), opens native Calendar Activity via `jp0.g` | force the row's `isVisible` ctor arg (`d00.a.e`) false |
| Message long-press "Calendar" | provider `ne1.y0$c.a(Context,v01.a,j51.a,Z)Lj51/c;` (reads `j51.c.CALENDAR`) | force it to `return null` |

**Events** (chat-menu row, `chatmenu_mainlist_button_events`) — **one** entry point only. A generic
`d00.z` row built in `ChatHistoryMenuFragment` (~the `d00.z.<init>` block using string `0x7f150dfa`
+ icon `0x7f0807ce`), gated by the boolean field `Lyz/s4;->l:Z` (the sole UI read of that field).
Opens a **server-configured web page** (`settings.e$c.D`), not the native calendar. Removed by
**"Hide Events button"** — because `d00.z` is shared by other rows, patch at the build site: replace
the `iget-boolean … s4.l` (matched by `fieldAccess(Lyz/s4;,"l")` + `literal(0x7f150dfa)`) with a
`const 0` into the same register.

**Message scheduler** ("send a message later"; `hg1.s`, strings `chat_scheduledmessages_*`) —
unrelated to Calendar/Events; opens the scheduled-message composer (`yr1.a`/`xr1.b`). Not currently
patched.

### Chats-tab header button set (context for `az0.q`)

The header button row (Chats tab, `com.linecorp.line.chattab.header.ChatTabHeaderStateImpl` =
`gw1.f`) is built from the Kotlin enum **`az0.q`** (constants `AI_FRIEND, ALBUM, CALENDAR, OPEN_CHAT,
PLUS_MENU` — names survive obfuscation). Buttons are `sget-object <az0.q const>` + `add(...)` into a
`ListBuilder` `fb8.b`. A separate green-dot icon `Set` uses `fb8.j` and does **not** include
`CALENDAR`. To hide a header button, remove its `sget`+`add` pair (see "Hide calendar buttons" header
row, and the sibling "Hide community button" which targets `OPEN_CHAT`).

---

## Main bottom-navigation tabs

Every tab patch edits the **same** builder: `wy7.b.a() → List<jp.naver.line.android.activity.main.a>`
(cached by `b()`), appending each tab as an `sget-object <main.a const>` + `ArrayList.add` pair. The
enum is **not obfuscated**, so fingerprint on `returnType = "Ljava/util/List;"` +
`fieldAccess(MAIN_TAB, "<CONST>")` and `removeInstructions(index, 2)`.

| Constant | Tracking name | Label resource | Shown when | Hidden by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `HOME` / `HOME26` / `GLOBALHOME` | `hometab` / `linehome` / `globalhome` | — | always (one of the three) | — |
| `CHAT` | `chatlist` | — | always | — |
| `COMMERCE` | `commercetab` | `gnb_commerce` — "Shopping" / ja **ショッピング** | `function.maintab.commercetab` (JP) | **Hide Shopping tab** |
| `COMMERCE_TW` | `commercetwtab` | `tw_commerce_tab_gnb` — "Discover" / zh-TW **逛逛** | `function.maintab.commercetwtab` (TW) | **Hide Shopping tab** |
| `SQUARE` | `squaretab` | — | `rm5.b.C()` | — |
| `TIMELINE` | `timeline` | — | `db0.k0.a(m2)` | Hide VOOM tab |
| `NEWS` / `NEWS_ROW` | `newstab` / `newsrowtab` | — | `s28.a.b()` / `kc3.d.a()` | Hide LINE TODAY tab |
| `CALL` | `call` | — | `y28.d.c()` | — |
| `MINI` / `WALLET` | `minitab` / `wallettab` | — | `m2.a().Y().d()` / `m2.a().H0().l()` | Hide Wallet tab |

**`COMMERCE`, `COMMERCE_TW`, `SQUARE` and `TIMELINE` share one `if`/`else-if` chain**, competing for a
single slot. Two rules follow:

- **Remove the `sget`+`add` pair; never force the gate false.** Forcing `jw4.u.h()`
  (`CommerceTabConfiguration.isCommerceTabEnabled`) false falls *through* the chain and surfaces
  `SQUARE` or `TIMELINE` in the freed slot — a tab the user never had. Removing only the body leaves
  the branch's trailing `goto`, so the slot stays empty, as stock LINE does when the gate is on.
- **Anchor each patch on its own constants only.** The tab patches run in arbitrary order against one
  method and each fingerprint resolves *after* earlier mutations, so anchoring on a constant another
  patch removes breaks the match. (Thus Hide Shopping tab avoids `TIMELINE` and `MINI`/`WALLET`; see
  also `hidevoomtab/Fingerprints.kt`.)

**A missing tab is safe everywhere.** Tab→index lookups are `Math.max(list.indexOf(...), 0)`, clamping
to Home (`jp/naver/line/android/activity/main/c.java`). `x66.d.a` only emits a `VoomSecondDepth`
telemetry event and `qy4.f0` only writes the `ADDITIONAL_MAIN_TAB` pref. The layout carries a view per
tab (`xy7.g` → `R.id.bnb_*`), so an absent entry never renders.

**The commerce tabs are region-gated, so they cannot be device-tested from TW** —
`function.maintab.commercetab` is server-pushed and off outside JP. Local proof stopped at
disassembly: both pairs gone, `if-eqz`/`goto` skeletons and the `SQUARE`/`TIMELINE` pairs intact,
whole-dex branch-offset sweep clean, all four tab patches coexisting under the full bundle. Then
**device-confirmed in JP on `v1.7.0-dev.1`** (2026-08-20, reporter of issue #59).

**A region-gated patch needs a pre-release and a tester in the region — plan for it.** Land on `dev`,
point the reporter at the auto-published pre-release tag, and hold the `dev → main` merge for a
screenshot. That is the only step separating "the instructions are gone" from "the tab is gone".

## Home tab modules

The Home tab renders a single server-driven `List<m52.z>`. Everything on the tab is one of these
modules — the friends list, the service icons, the ads, and the whole content feed below the friends
list. Three patches filter that list: *Hide Home modules*, *Hide Home content feed*, and
*Disable LINE Premium*. If you change this surface, update all three call sites.

**The chain.** `v52.g.a(Ls52/i;Lm52/m0;)` assembles the list from the GCS response (one giant
`packed-switch` over the payload oneof; **jadx fails on this method** — `Method not decompiled` — so
read `apktool/smali_classes9/v52/g.smali`; the `FLEX` arm is separate, at `v52/g.smali:5748` and
`jadx/sources/v52/j.java:191`). The list is stored as the first ctor arg (field `a`) of the Compose
state `x72.h$a`, and rendered at `v72/c2.java:296-300` via `r72.d(z.f229498a, z.f229502e.getType())`.

**Where to filter: `x72.h$a.<init>(List, Z×5, String, Long, Long, I, Z)`, index 0.** Every build path
and every state copy funnels through this constructor, so one branchless
`invoke-static {p1}` + `move-result-object p1` covers the whole tab. Two rules, both learned the hard
way:

- **The loop must live in a new method.** A backward-branching loop injected into an existing method
  corrupts the branch layout into a runtime `VerifyError`. Add
  `x72.h$a.filterHomeModules` / `filterHomeFeed` / `filterPremiumModules` with
  `mutableClassDefBy(...).methods.add(...)` and inject only the call.
- **All three patches prepend at index 0, and that is safe.** Each one is a pure `List → List`
  filter on `p1`. Thus the patch that applies last runs first. The dex confirms it: the ctor starts
  with the `invoke-static` + `move-result-object v1` pairs chained, then the original
  `Object.<init>` + `iput-object v1 → field a`.
- The earlier target `i52.c.e` built only the Friends sub-tab list (a single
  `FriendsSubTabFriendsList`), not the feed — confirmed via on-device logging.

### Module type inventory (LINE 26.11.0) — 45 types

`m52.a0` is a marker interface with one member, `getType() : String`. 43 implementations are nested
in `m52/a0.java`; **two are top-level and easy to miss** (`m52.c0`, `m52.d0`).

| `getType()` | Class | Surface | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `HomeContentsRecommendation` | `a0$s` | recommended stickers / content | **Hide Home modules** (device-confirmed) |
| `HomePerformanceAd` | `a0$j0` | performance ads in the feed | **Hide Home modules** (device-confirmed) |
| `FLEX` | `a0$f` | 即時夯話題 hot topics **and** the bottom promo/ad block | **Hide Home modules** (device-confirmed) |
| `AdModel` | `a0$a` | generic ad module (`GcsAdModuleViewData` / `GcsAdMeta`) | **Hide Home modules** (static evidence only — never seen on device) |
| `HomeFeedPost` | `a0$z` | OA / LINE NEWS post card | **Hide Home content feed** |
| `HomeFeedLiveSingle` | `a0$w` | the `OA_LIVE` variant | **Hide Home content feed** |
| `HomeFeedMatomeSingle` / `-Carousel` | `a0$y` / `a0$x` | AI-digest ("matome") news cards | **Hide Home content feed** |
| `HomeFeedUnitBigVisual` / `-Grid` / `-Ranking` / `-ShortFormGrid` / `-Single` / `-SingleAndGrid` | `a0$b0`–`a0$g0` | content-unit layouts, each wrapping posts | **Hide Home content feed** |
| `HomeFeedDefaultPageError` / `-DefaultPageLoading` / `HomeFeedError` / `HomeFeedSeedPostError` | `a0$t` / `a0$u` / `a0$v` / `a0$a0` | that feed's error & spinner placeholders | **Hide Home content feed** |
| `FriendsSubTabFriendsList`, `-AllAlbum`, `-Calendar`, `-LatestNotifications`, `-RecentlyUpdatedProfiles` | `a0$i`, `a0$g`, `a0$h`, `a0$j`, `a0$k` | the friends list and its sub-tabs | kept |
| `HomeSocialGraph`, `HomeRecentlyProfileUpdate`, `HomeActivityFriendList`, `GlobalHomeFriendList` | `a0$m0`, `a0$k0`, `a0$r`, `a0$o` | friend updates / profiles | kept |
| `HomeServiceList`, `GlobalHomeServiceSection`, `SquareJoinedChatList`, `HomeNotificationHub` | `a0$l0`, `a0$p`, `a0$q0`, `a0$i0` | service icons, OpenChat list, notification hub | kept |
| `HomeTopBanner`, `SafetyCheckBanner`, `HomeLimitedNetworkModeBanner` | `a0$o0`, `a0$p0`, `a0$h0` | banners (not identified as ads) | kept |
| `GlobalHomePageError`, `GlobalHomeError`, `GlobalHomePageLoading` | `a0$l`, `a0$n`, `a0$m` | whole-tab error / loading | kept |
| `CommerceTwTabFriendshipGifts`, `-GreetingBanners`, `-QuickPolls`, `-Shortcuts` | `a0$b`–`a0$e` | the TW commerce tab | kept |
| `HomeActivityCard` | `a0$q` | recommendation surface (`contentList` / `extraContentList`) | **not blocked** — no device evidence |
| `GcsHomeActivityHybridContentCard` | `m52.d0` (top-level) | the hybrid variant of the above | **not blocked** — no device evidence |
| `HomeTabLypRecommendation` | `a0$n0` | LYP premium upsell | **Disable LINE Premium** (third lever, no device evidence — see `line-premium-map.md`) |
| `GcsDummyHybridModule` | `m52.c0` (top-level) | dev/dummy, no renderer | kept |

**Take this table from jadx, never from a smali grep.** 17 of the 43 nested classes are Kotlin
singletons whose `getType()` returns a `static final` field, so a grep for the literal nearest
`getType` silently reports a *neighbouring* method's string. `a0$m` is the trap: `getType()` returns
`"GlobalHomePageLoading"` while its `toString()` says `"GlobalHomeDefaultPageLoading"`.

### Why the content feed is matched by prefix

Every type in the feed below the friends list starts with `HomeFeed` (network models `GcsHomeFeed*`,
including `GcsHomeFeedScrollAffordance` — it is an infinite scroller). The server rotates between card
variants, so a literal list reopens the hole on the next rotation. The extension tests
`type.startsWith("HomeFeed")` instead. The error and loading placeholders are included on purpose, so
no orphan spinner or error shell is left where the cards were.

That covers the *module* spinners. It does not cover the page footer spinner, because that spinner
is not a module. The section that follows covers it.

**No `function.*` config gate exists for this feed.** `function.hometab.*`, `function.line_home.*` and
`function.my_home.*` carry no feed switch, so filtering the module list is the only cheap mechanism —
this is not a "force the gate false" surface.

### Filtering a paged list starts a refetch loop — the second and third levers

**The general lesson, before the detail: LINE measures the page *after* our filter runs.** When you
remove items from a paged surface, the change thus feeds back into the pager. Every future
list-filtering patch must check whether the surface pages. A patch that does not check ships a
silent refetch loop. `hidehomefeed` needed two levers more than the filter. The reporter of issue
 #69 found the first one on `v1.8.0-dev.2`.

**`x72.h$a` is `PageData`.** The ctor is
`(List, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, String, Long, Long, I, Z)` and holds, in order: `modules`, `isPageReady`,
`isPageRefreshing`, `isError`, `isPullToRefreshLoading`, **`isLoadingMore`**, `orderRequestId`,
`expiredTimeMillis`, `pageUpdatedTimeMillis`, `revision`, `isSafeMode`. The `toString()` of the
class names every field, thus it gives the order. Cross-check that order against the four consumers
(`v72/q.java`, `v72/r.java`, `v72/s.java`, `v72/t.java`). **Re-check this order on a version bump.**
The patch writes ctor parameter 6 by position.

**LINE has no empty state.** `GcsModuleListViewDataFacade.viewDataFlow` (`v72/u.java`) reduces
`PageData` to `v72.n`:

```java
if (any x in list has f333354g != 0) return new n.a(revision, list, delayedIsLoadingMore); // Content
if (isError) return n.b;                                                                   // Error
return delayedIsPageRefreshing ? n.d : n.c;                                                // Loading : Idle
```

`x.f333354g` counts the sub-items of the module. "Shows nothing" and "still loads" are thus the
same state to LINE. The renderer `v72/x0.java` makes lazy-list items from that state. `n.d` becomes
a whole-page spinner (line 142). Inside `n.a`, an `isLoadingMoreContent` adds the `q2.LOADING_MORE`
footer (line 291).

**The pager trigger** is `v72/m1.java:81` — `lastVisibleIndex + 6 >= itemCount`, gated on
`isPageReady`. A tab with no feed is short, thus this condition stays true always. One place reads
the trigger: `v72/o1.java:38`
(`GcsPageState$observeEventsForLoadingModuleContent$1`), which calls `d2.B1(shouldLoadMore)`.

**The fetch** is `v72.h2.B1(Z)V` (`v72/h2.java:44`), the one implementation of `B1` that does work.
`v72/o1.java:38` is its only caller in the app. Each fetch returns feed modules, and the filter
discards them. The item count does not grow, thus the next fetch starts. The server sends an endless
feed, so the `i0Var.f229286b` ("no more pages") guard is never true.

| Lever | Site | Injection |
|---|---|---|
| 1. filter the list | `x72.h$a.<init>` index 0 | `invoke-static filterHomeFeed` + `move-result-object p1` |
| 2. hide the footer | same block | `const/4 p6, 0x0` (p6 = `isLoadingMore`, `.locals 0`, 12 registers, so v6) |
| 3. stop the pager | `v72.h2.B1(Z)V` index 0 | `return-void` |

**Lever 3 is safe because LINE ships an empty `B1` of its own.** `b82/z.java` implements `v72.d2`
with every method empty, `B1` included. An empty `B1` is thus a state that LINE itself builds. Only
load-more goes through `B1`. The initial load, the pull-to-refresh and the visibility are separate
interface methods (`P4`, `R2`, `Q1`, `L`, `r5`, `w6`, `n4`).

**Anchor lever 3 on shape, never on the drift-prone name `B1`.** Use `returnType = "V"`,
`parameters = ["Z"]`, plus `fieldAccess(type = "Lx72/h;")` and `checkCast("Lm52/i0;")`. On LINE
26.11.0 that combination matches one method in the whole APK. A sweep of every `.smali` confirms it.

Lever 3 prevents the spinner on its own, but lever 2 stays. Lever 2 costs one instruction on a
fingerprint that the patch already owns. Field `f` has one reader, thus lever 2 cannot break
anything else.

### The feed is region-driven — plan for a remote tester

Issue #69 (JP) reported LINE NEWS cards surviving every ad patch. The cards are `HomeFeedPost`,
identified by `GcsHomeFeedPost.platform{type ∈ {OA_POST, YOUTUBE, LINE_NEWS, LIVE_PREVIEW}, name}` (the
`carview! / LINE NEWS` header pair), `home_post_desc_linenews` = "LINE NEWS"
(`values-ja/strings.xml:5218`), `lineNewsContent{title, imageUrl}`, `createdTime`, `likeReaction` (the
きになる pill) and `home_post_menu_accounthide` (the ⋮ menu). Renderer `ze2.h extends l72.g<a0.z>`.

They were never blocked because PR #15 locked the blocklist to what a **Taiwan** account renders —
PR #14's `MorpheHomeModules` logcat showed `size=8` with **no** `HomeFeed*` type at all. Same lesson as
the commerce tabs: a region-gated surface needs a pre-release and a tester in the region.

**Diagnostic recipe** (from PR #11, revert before shipping): log every type at filter entry under tag
`MorpheHomeModules`, then `adb logcat -c && adb logcat -s MorpheHomeModules`. No lines = the filter
never ran; `ENTER` with no per-type lines = empty list at that point; per-type lines = the real strings.

### Finer discriminators, if a type string is ever too coarse

`m52.z` carries more than the payload: `f229498a` = module id (for example
`home-feed-module_home-feed-default-page-loading`; **LINE itself filters on it** at `an2/d.java:75`),
`f229499b` = module name, `f229500c`/`f229501d` = timestamps, `f229502e` = the `m52.a0` payload,
`f229503f` = ACI gate enum `m52.m0` (`DISABLED` / `ACI_REQUIRED` / `ALWAYS`), `f229504g` = upstream
request id, `f229505h` = global service key, `f229506i` = render kind (`FLEX` / `NATIVE` / `HYBRID`).
Inside the `HomeFeedUnit*` payloads there is also `type: m52.l0` (`AUTO` / `PACKAGED` / `KEYWORD` /
`FITTED` / `MANUAL`) and `contentType: m52.k0` (`MASS` / `CLUSTER` / `PERSONAL`).

Renderers subclass `l72.g<T>` / `r72.b<T>` and register a `KClass`, so the renderer confirms a type
actually paints: `a0$z`→`ze2/h.java`, `a0$x`→`mg2/h.java`, `a0$y`→`ng2/g.java`, `a0$s`→`tg2/n.java`,
`a0$j0`→`ec2/f.java`, `a0$f`→`d62/r.java`, `a0$m0`→`f30/b.java`, `a0$l0`→`b30/b.java`,
`a0$n0`→`ac2/k.java`, `m52.d0`→`sd2/i.java`.

### Values that drift on a version bump

`x72.h$a` (state class + ctor signature), `m52.z` field `e`, `m52.a0` and every `a0$*` letter suffix,
the assembler `v52.g`, the consumer `v72.c2`. The **type strings themselves are server contract** and
have been stable; re-run the jadx sweep over `m52/a0.java` to re-audit the `HomeFeed*` family, in case
LINE adds a wanted module under that prefix.

## Ads — bundled SDKs, display coverage, and the parts not patched

Audited on LINE 26.11.0, 2026-08-24. Issue #69 showed that a Taiwan account does not render
every ad surface, so this audit asks one question. **Does the APK hold an ad that no patch
covers?** The display answer is no. The parts that stay are below, with the reason for each.

### Bundled ad and tracking SDKs

| SDK | Package | State in the app |
|---|---|---|
| Google Mobile Ads (AdMob / AdManager) | `com.google.android.gms.ads` (`smali_classes6`, `smali_classes7`) | Starts by itself through the `MobileAdsInitProvider` content provider (`initOrder=100`), before LINE code runs. App id `ca-app-pub-6968037135561499~1985034154` |
| LINE Ads SDK v1 (`Lad*`) | `com.linecorp.line.ladsdk` | Inventories `smartch`, `openchat`, `timeline` |
| LINE Ads SDK v2 (`Lyad*`, LINE Yahoo Ads) | `com.linecorp.line.ladsdk.ui.v2` | The newer tier of the same SDK |
| Yahoo Japan A-Cookie | `jp.co.yahoo.android.ads.acookie` | An ad identifier. Starts at every app launch in every region — see below |
| Yahoo edgeAI | `jp.co.yahoo.android.edgeai` (122 classes) | Downloads and deploys on-device models (`LoadModelWorker`, CoreML, model endpoints) |

### Display coverage is complete, and here is the proof

Do not repeat this sweep from memory. Three checks together show that every ad **view** goes
through a class that `hideadviews` hooks:

- The Google ad view bases have four subclasses in the APK: `fl5/b` gives `fl5/c` and `fl5/d`,
  and `f93/a` gives `f93/b` and `f93/c`. `fl5/e` and `fl5/f` extend `FrameLayout` directly.
  Those six are exactly the six that the patch covers.
- No other `View` subclass in the app names `AdManagerAdView` or `AdView`. The other classes
  that name them (`al5/d`, `c93/g`, `fl5/a`, `fl5/g`, `f93/h`, `gl5/*`, `jl5/d`) are loaders,
  view models, or coroutine lambdas, and not views.
- Inside `ladsdk`, `LadAdView` and `LyadAdView` are the only lifecycle containers. Every other
  class there (`LadPostHeaderView`, `LadSlotAssetRecyclerView`, the Lights views, and more) is
  an asset view that lives inside one of the two containers.

### Server-gated ad surfaces

About 80 `function.*` keys gate an ad placement. The server sends these values per account, so
a region cannot be read from the APK. The list matters because a Taiwan account renders only
some of them:

| Surface | Key prefix | Render path |
|---|---|---|
| Home tab Google banner | `function.hometab.ad_rc.*`, `function.hometab.ads.displayrate*` | Google view, covered |
| Chats tab Google banner | `function.chattab.ad_rc.*` | Google view, covered |
| Smart Channel | `function.chattab.smartch.*` | `Hide ad views` and `Remove banner ads` |
| Album ads | `function.album.ad.*`, `function.moa.album.ad.*` | LAD inventory, covered |
| Note ads | `function.note.ad.{list,end}_inventory_key` | LAD inventory, covered |
| OpenChat header ads (4 places) | `function.square.{chatroom,note,thread_space,your_threads}.header_ad.*` | LAD or Google, covered |
| OpenChat in-stream ads | `function.square.chatroom.integration_ad.*` | **not confirmed** |
| Official Account talkroom ads | `function.official_account.talkroom_ad.*` | **not confirmed** |
| Sticker keyboard promo banners | `function.sticker_keyboard.banner.*` | not covered, and not an ad SDK surface |

### Investigated and deliberately not patched

Each item below is patchable. None of them ships, because the gain is invisible and the risk is
real. **Do not add these to `hideadviews`.** That patch is default-on and device-confirmed, and
one more anchor that drifts makes the whole patch fail. A drifted anchor thus breaks a visible
patch to protect something that no user can see.

**The Yahoo A-Cookie startup task.** `s68/a` is `ACookieTask`, a `LineInitializationTask` that
`o68/i` registers. The body of `f()` is one call to `YJACookieLibrary.init(context)`, with no
region check and no config gate. `jb0/d` (tagged `"LAD-SDK"`) is a consumer.

A `return-void` stops it. But `init` is not a flag. It resolves `wq7.a` to `tq7.a` to `rq7.j`,
calls `j.d(context)`, moves a `"COOKIES"` SharedPreferences entry, and registers an
`Application` lifecycle callback. Without it, `getValue()` and `getValueWithName()` read an
`rq7.j` whose `SharedPreferences` field is null. That is the shape of the `hidepremium` crash:
a value that was never null becomes null, and a consumer with no null guard fails. The
consumers here are LAD SDK code. The gain is one identifier less, while LEGY, Firebase,
Crashlytics, Sentry and the LINE analytics stay.

**The AdMob content provider.** A manifest patch can remove `MobileAdsInitProvider`. Google
Mobile Ads also starts on first use, thus the patch delays the start and does not stop it. The
ad loaders (`al5/d`, `c93/g`, `gl5/*`, `fl5/a`) still run after the views are hidden. If they
call an SDK that did not start, the patch adds a crash path and hides nothing new.

**Yahoo edgeAI.** A bytecode patch does not make the APK smaller. If the models never load, a
patch does nothing. If they do load, we do not know what reads them. There is no case either
way.

### Open, and waiting for a user report

Two display surfaces do not resolve to `LadAdView`, to `LyadAdView`, or to one of the six
Google wrappers. A Taiwan account renders neither, thus a device report must come first:

- `function.square.chatroom.integration_ad.*` puts ads between the messages of an OpenChat
  room. The key `embed_ad_interval_minutes` sets the interval.
- `function.official_account.talkroom_ad.*` puts ads in an Official Account chat room. The
  table `OfficialAccountTalkroomAdData` holds the data, and `w28` holds the schema. The
  renderer is not identified.

**Plan a patch when a user reports one of these, and not before.** The audit above is the
starting point, so no one needs to sweep the APK again.

## Shipped / proposed patches (this line of work)

| Patch (name) | Package | Targets |
|---|---|---|
| Hide calendar buttons | `line.hidecalendar` | the 5 Calendar surfaces above |
| Hide Events button | `line.hideevents` | the `d00.z` Events chat-menu row |
| Hide Transfer button | `line.hidetransfer` | `hg1.k` (`+` Transfer/LINE Pay tile) |
| Hide LINE GIFT button | `line.hidegift` | `hg1.h` (`+` LINE GIFT tile) |
| Hide attach menu extra tools | `line.hideattachmenutools` | all server-driven `hg1.d` services |
| Redirect LINE Pay | `line.disablepay` | `PayLaunchActivity` / `PayLiffActivity` onCreate (see below) |
| Keep unsent messages | `line.keepunsent` | `g38.b0.invoke` — the unsend DB write (see below) |
| Hide Shopping tab | `line.hideshoppingtab` | `COMMERCE` + `COMMERCE_TW` in `wy7.b.a()` (see above) |

Each is an independent, `default = true`, user-facing `bytecodePatch` — one feature (or one feature's
full set of entry points) per patch. Most are instruction-level edits; *Redirect LINE Pay* and *Keep
unsent messages* carry extension code.

## LINE Pay intake & the "Redirect LINE Pay" patch

**Why redirect instead of disable:** the messenger cannot run its own Pay flow on a re-signed build
(the bundled VKey/V-Guard check fails — see `CLAUDE.md`). The patch (still packaged
`line.disablepay`, object `disablePayPatch`) forwards the payment to the user's separately-installed
**standalone LINE Pay app** — unpatched, so integrity passes — then closes the in-app Pay screen. A
failed hand-off degrades to the old "just close" behavior.

### How an external pay URL enters LINE (decompiled 26.11.0)

```
merchant "LINE Pay" link  (line:// or https://line.me/R/…)
  ► jp.naver.line.android.activity.schemeservice.LineSchemeServiceActivity   (EXPORTED router)
  ► v98.d.d(...) dispatcher → pay handlers (gv3.j / on3.k / ru3.f)
  ► iv3.a.b(ctx, ao3.b)  → Intent(PayLaunchActivity, data=line://pay/…)      [not exported]
    iv3.a.c(...) / PayLiffActivity$a.a(...) → Intent(PayLiffActivity, extra "linepay.intent.extra.URI")
```

- **`PayLaunchActivity`** (`Lcom/linecorp/line/pay/base/PayLaunchActivity;`) — general front door; URL
  is `getIntent().getDataString()` (a `line://pay/…` form).
- **`PayLiffActivity`** (`Lcom/linecorp/line/pay/impl/liff/common/PayLiffActivity;`) — the LIFF/web path
  for the `waitPreLogin` / `lpUsage=STANDALONE` flow. Reads its `Uri` from intent extra
  **`linepay.intent.extra.URI`** (field `f73569l`) and calls LINE's resolver **`l5().r7(uri)`**
  (obfuscated `sv3.n`) for the real `https://web-pay.line.me/…` URL before loading it in a WebView.
- `web-pay.line.me` / `web-tw-pay.line.me` / `/R/iab` are **not** literals in the APK or manifest —
  those hosts are server config. So an `ACTION_VIEW` for `https://web-tw-pay.line.me/R/iab?…` fired
  from inside LINE is not caught by the messenger. It resolves to the standalone app.

### The redirect

Both Pay activities are intercepted at `onCreate`, right after `super.onCreate`
(`PayLaunchActivityOnCreateFingerprint` / `PayLiffActivityOnCreateFingerprint`, `methodCall("onCreate")`
= the super call). Injected: `invoke-static {p0}, …LinePayRedirect;->redirect` then `finish(); return-void`.
The extension (`app/andrewliang/extension/LinePayRedirect.java`) reads the intent (extra
`linepay.intent.extra.URI`, else `getDataString()`) and builds the standalone url:

- **`…/pay/payment/<reserveId>`** deep link (the merchant checkout case) — the last path segment IS
  the `transactionReserveId` (**device-confirmed**: it decodes identically to the reserve id in the
  known-good web-pay url). Rebuilds
  `https://web-pay.line.me/web/payment/waitPreLogin?transactionReserveId=<reserveId>&locale=zh-TW_LP`.
- an already-resolved `web-pay.line.me` url — used as-is.
- anything else (for example `line://pay/main`) — no reserve id → **no redirect**, the activity just
  `finish()`es (a loop guard: never wrap a link that would round-trip back to the messenger).

then fires

```
https://web-tw-pay.line.me/R/iab?url=<urlencoded inner web-pay url>
```

with `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK`, swallowing all exceptions so `finish()` always runs. A token-free
breadcrumb is logged under logtag **`AndrewLinePay`**. The single-use reserve id deliberately is not.

**Device-confirmed (LINE 26.11.0):** tapping a merchant "LINE Pay" button
(`http://line.me/R/pay/payment/<reserveId>`) reaches **`PayLaunchActivity`** with
`getDataString() == line://pay/payment/<reserveId>` — not `PayLiffActivity`, whose extra was null —
and the reconstruction opened the standalone app on the transaction. The `PayLiffActivity` hook is
kept as defensive coverage for the `lpUsage=STANDALONE` route; if a future version routes there with
no usable web url in the intent, reuse LINE's `r7()` resolver (anchor on the stable `"lpUsage"` /
`"STANDALONE"` literals and read the obfuscated `l5()`/`r7()` descriptors from the matches — do not
hardcode `sv3.n`, which drifts).

## Message unsend (receive side) & the "Keep unsent messages" patch

### How an incoming unsend reaches the database

```
OpType NOTIFIED_DESTROY_MESSAGE(65) / DESTROY_MESSAGE(64)   (Lcb8/ce;, Operation = Lcb8/de;)
  ► e98.c1.b(...)  (someone else unsent)   /   e98.r  (3-line subclass: your own unsend)
  ► the g38.b0 lambda, run inside a chat_history transaction
```

Both ops funnel through the **same** lambda, so one patch site covers your own unsends too.

**LINE does not delete the row for 1:1/group chats.** `Lg38/b0;->invoke(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;`
(`smali_classes4/g38/b0.smali`) rewrites `chat_history.type` to an `i38.c.UNSENT*` variant, NULLs
`content`, `parameter`, `attachement_type` and the location columns via `h38.h0` →
`Lh38/b;->g(SQLiteDatabase, Li38/k;, Lh38/h0;)I`, drops the message from the full-text-search index and
deletes its `reactions` / `multiple_image_message_mapping` rows — all behind one guard:

```smali
    :cond_0
    iget-object v6, v10, Li38/b;->g:Li38/c;   # v10 = the fetched row
    iget-wide  v7, v10, Li38/b;->b:J          # message id (live at the guard)
    invoke-virtual {v6}, Li38/c;->h()Z        # already an unsend tombstone?
    move-result v6
    if-eqz v6, :cond_1                        # no  -> destructive block
    goto/16 :goto_c                           # yes -> skip, return the row unchanged
```

Forcing that register non-zero makes the unsend a **local no-op**. `Lg38/f3;` (the lambda's
parameter, `v1`) carries the transaction's `SQLiteDatabase` in field `b`.

**OpenChat/Square is a different path and genuinely deletes**: `SquareEventType.NOTIFIED_DESTROY_MESSAGE(5)`
→ `fp5.i` → `Lg38/q0;->m(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/util/Set;)V` → `g38.f3.c(Set)` →
`DELETE FROM chat_history WHERE id IN(...)`. Not covered by the patch.

A third path covers messages unsent while offline: full sync / message-box restore reads
`z58.b.c.KEY_UNSENT_MESSAGE` / `KEY_SILENTLY_UNSENT` from `contentMetadata` (`g38.q0`, `g38.x2`) and
stores the row already stripped — nothing local to keep.

### How the placeholder is rendered

`chat_history.type` → content model → text, four hops:

| Hop | Descriptor |
|---|---|
| cursor → content model | `Lh38/t;->e(Lcb8/q7;Ljp/naver/line/android/util/j;Lz58/b;)Li38/g;` — `UNSENT` builds `Li38/g$s$h0;` from `from_mid` |
| content → UI model | `Lm11/b;->k(Li38/g$s;)Ll11/h;` → `Ll11/h$h0;` |
| UI model → text | `Lcl1/c;->a(Landroid/content/Context;Ll11/h;Lo21/a;)Ljava/lang/CharSequence;` |
| bubble decoration | `Lwi1/j4;->K0(...)` — appends the "How to unsend discreetly" link on *your own* unsends (suppressed by *Hide premium unsend upsells*) |

Strings: `chathistory_message_format_unsent_receiver` (`0x7f150d65`, "%1$s unsent a message.") and
`chathistory_message_format_unsent_sender` (`0x7f150d66`, "You unsent a message.") — chosen by
comparing `from_mid` against your own mid.

`Lh38/x;` (query builder) filters `UNSENT_SILENT` out of chat history entirely
(`type NOT IN (...)`), which is how LYP "unsend discreetly" hides a row it still stores.

### What the patch does

Skips the guard, then inserts its **own** `type = UNSENT` row so the notice still appears
(`app/andrewliang/extension/KeepUnsentMessages.java`). Leaving the original row untouched — rather than
copying it and letting LINE tombstone the original — preserves its real `server_id`, so reply-jump,
forwarding and reactions keep working on the kept message.

The guard is located **by instruction shape** (no-arg `Z` call → `move-result` → `if-eqz` → `goto`) and
the `SQLiteDatabase` field reference is read from the method's own bytecode, because `i38.c`, its `h()`
and `g38.f3.b` all drift. The two register reads are anchored rather than scanned blind: the message id
must be a field of the same row object the guard reads its receiver off, and the `SQLiteDatabase` holder
register must carry a `check-cast` to the field's own owner before the guard (this method has a *second*
`SQLiteDatabase` read, `h38.t0.a`, reusing register `v1` for a different type). Anything unresolvable —
including a register past `v15`, where `iget`/`invoke` operands stop fitting — throws rather than
applying a half-patch.

The insert is skipped when the row is **already** a tombstone (`type IN (27, 28, 38)`, what `i38.c.h()`
covers). The injection sits ahead of the branch it flips, so it also runs where LINE's guard would have
exited early: a redelivered unsend for a row tombstoned before the patch was installed, or one stripped
by the offline `KEY_UNSENT_MESSAGE` path, which never reaches the guard at all. Both would otherwise
draw the notice twice.

### Values that drift on a version bump

| Thing | 26.11.0 |
|---|---|
| `chat_history` table (`a68.a`) | only `id` constrained (PK + autoincrement); all other columns nullable; `IDX_SERVER_ID` is **non-unique** |
| sort columns | `IDX_CHAT_ID_ID_CREATED_TIME` = `chat_id` (eq) + `created_time`, `id` (sort) → ordering follows `created_time` |
| `created_time` | `DATE_STRING` → a **TEXT** column of epoch millis, so `+1` needs a `CAST` round-trip |
| `i38.c` db values | `MESSAGE` = 1, `UNSENT` = 27, `UNSENT_NO_MARK` = 28, `SQUARE_UNSENT_MESSAGE` = 35, `UNSENT_SILENT` = 38 — the extension hardcodes 27 (the type it writes) and 27/28/38 (`i38.c.h()`'s set, the rows it refuses to annotate) |
| `cb8.q7.NONE` | 0 (`attachement_type`) |
| chat-list unread badge | `chat.message_count - chat.read_message_count` (`c23.d` columns, read in `z13.o`) — a stored counter pair, **not** a `count(*)` over `chat_history`, so the inserted placeholder cannot move it |

---

## Outbound photo pipeline (reference — no patch ships for this)

> **A "Send original photos without the quality drop" patch was built, device-confirmed (a 126.5 MP /
> 34 MB photo arrived at 24 MP instead of 1.64 MP, via five sites across two send paths plus an
> extension), and then deliberately dropped.** Recorded so nobody re-derives it. Why it was dropped:
>
> - **Coverage cannot match the promise.** It fixed the chatroom `+` / photo-strip flow only. Album is
>   unfixable without inflating every album upload (no "Original" button, below), share-to-LINE is a
>   third path never traced, and a user cannot tell which entry point they used. A patch that silently
>   applies to some sends invites bug reports.
> - **Maintenance is a re-investigation, not a fingerprint refresh.** Four fingerprints, one on a
>   synthetic Kotlin lambda (`th1.t$c$b`) that reshuffles whenever its enclosing method changes — and
>   four device rounds went to sites that disassembled perfectly on a path that never executed. Each
>   LINE bump needs a device send with an oversized photo, not just a clean build.
> - **The trigger is rare.** A 12 MP phone JPEG is 3–6 MB; crossing 20 MB needs a 50–200 MP mode, and
>   the 100 MP gate needs pixel-shift.
>
> If revived, the minimal form is **`th1.t$c$b`'s two literals alone** — one fingerprint, two
> `replaceInstruction` calls, no extension. With the flag preserved an oversized JPEG takes LINE's
> stock raw byte copy at *full* resolution, losslessly — better output than the 24 MP q80 re-encode
> the extension produced, which only existed to keep ~34 MB off the wire.

### The two paths a photo can take

`u13.c1.f(dVar, fVar, uri, rotation)` writes the local file that gets uploaded. A photo has exactly
two outcomes, with no tier in between — that is the defect.

| `cw0.f` | What `c1.f` does |
|---|---|
| `IMAGE_STANDARD` | `c1.p()` only — resample to the tier's **pixel budget** and JPEG re-encode |
| `IMAGE_ORIGINAL` | `c1.p()` *and* the `u13.y0` lambda, which raw-copies or full-res re-encodes |

`d98.m1` then uploads **one** of them (`IMAGE_ORIGINAL` when the message metadata carries
`IS_SEND_ORIGINAL_IMAGE`, else `IMAGE_STANDARD`) plus a thumbnail. OBS derives the rest by URL
path (`w78.b`): `…/r/talk/m/<id>` standard, `…/m/<id>/original`, `…/m/<id>/preview`.

### The pixel budget is a *total*, not a per-side cap

`c1.k(STANDARD_IMAGE)` returns `maxDimension²` **pixels**. `c1.m()` returns the bitmap untouched
when `width*height <= budget`, so raising `maxDimension` past a photo's pixel count disables
resampling entirely. `c1.l()` decodes to within `budget * 4` first (`mul-int/lit8 … 0x4`) and then
scales precisely — that multiplier is what avoids coarse power-of-two subsampling, so lowering it
costs quality for any source between 1x and 4x the budget.

Values come from `jp.naver.line.android.util.f1.a()` — non-obfuscated, and the best anchor into
this whole area:

| Tier | Class | Server key | Default | Selected when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Normal | `t88.a$b$b` | `function.media.image_medium` | 1280 / q70 → **1.64 MP** | `RESIZE_IMAGE_OPTION != 2` (incl. unset) |
| High | `t88.a$b$a` | `function.media.image_high` | 2048 / q80 → **4.19 MP** | `RESIZE_IMAGE_OPTION == 2` |

`p38.a.c` is `NORMAL(0) / SMALL(1) / LARGE(2)`, but `f1` tests for exactly `2`, so `SMALL` is dead
for uploads (it only suffixes download URLs in `r78.h`). The tiers are **separate classes**, which
is what lets a patch touch one without the other. Four consumers: `dw0.c` (chat), `gg3.j`,
`ch0.j`, `od7.d`.

### The cliff

`t73.k0.b0()` stamps `rt7.c.isOriginal` (field `B`) per item as the picker finalises. With the
"Original" toggle on it clears the flag at `>= 20 MB` (`0x1400000`) or `>= 100 MP` (`0x5f5e100`),
dropping the photo onto the standard path. One byte under the threshold a photo is copied
verbatim; one byte over it loses 6–25x its pixels, with the toggle still showing on. The only hint
is `gallery_original_guide_error` — *"Videos and some photos may be sent in standard resolution."*

Nothing validates the encoded output: `c1.o()` is a single-shot `Bitmap.compress` with no size
check, and `b0()` / `m63.n0.d()` test the **source**'s length and dimensions, never the result.

The `u13.y0` lambda branches on mime (`ww0.c.a`): `image/jpeg|png|gif|bmp` (and an unresolvable
type) → raw byte copy, then `i48.a.b` strips 38 GPS/timestamp EXIF tags (Orientation survives);
anything else (HEIC, WEBP) → full-res decode + `Matrix` rotate + JPEG at the tier quality.

### The `>= 20 MB / >= 100 MP` test exists in FIVE places

The most important fact here, and it cost four device rounds. The same literals (`0x1400000`,
`0x5f5e100`) are duplicated across two independent send paths plus Album, and **any one alone is
enough to drop the photo to the standard variant**:

| Copy | Decides | On the chatroom path? |
|---|---|---|
| `th1.t$c$b.invoke` | `Function1<w51.c, Boolean>`; `un1.f.a` calls it per item and feeds the result into `un1.k$b$c(Uri, isOriginal)` → `IS_SEND_ORIGINAL_IMAGE` | **yes — this is the one that decides** |
| `m63.n0.f()` / `d()` | media-picker toggle availability → `m63.n0.i(Z)` → `u53.e.a` | no |
| `t73.k0.b0` | media-picker per-item `rt7.c.B` stamp | no |
| `wi0.h.g` | LINE **Album**'s own compressor (`ri0.c.c`, `com.linecorp.line.album.transfer.*`) | no |
| `th1.u.invokeSuspend` | guide text only (`ORIGINAL_IMAGE_GUIDE` vs `ERROR_GUIDE`, via `th1.c0`/`d0`) | cosmetic |

Two send paths reach `u13.c1.f`, and they do **not** share the decision:

- **Chatroom `+` / photo strip** — `th1.t.h(Z)` reads the toggle (`t.f()` = the toggle view's
  `isSelected()`), launches `th1.t$c`, and passes `th1.t$c$b` to `un1.f.a`. `th1.a0` builds fresh
  `rt7.c` items with `B = t.f()`. **The media picker is never involved.**
- **Full gallery picker** — `m63.n0` + `t73.k0.b0`.

`wi0.h.g` is deliberately left alone: Album has **no "Original" button**, so its `IMAGE_ORIGINAL`
branch is unreachable and the only lever left is the always-compress branch, which would inflate
every album upload. Album's config is `ch0.j.m()` → `ei0.n(maxDimension², quality, 8192|1280)` off
the *same* `f1.a()` tier as chat, so if an Original button ever appears the fix is to swap that
config for a bounded one, not to neutralise the gate.

### What the dropped patch did (for reference)

Five sites. Site A was the one device-confirmed to decide the outcome; Sites 0 and 1 covered the
gallery-picker path and were never device-verified.

- **A.** `th1.t$c$b` — both gate literals → `0x7fffffff`, so the per-item predicate is always true.
- **0.** `m63.n0` — both literals in *every method holding both* (`f()` and `d()`). `onClick`'s lone
  `0x1400000` is a free-disk-space multiplier (`getFreeSpace() >= 20 MB * itemCount`) — never touch
  it, which is why the rule keys on "contains both" rather than on the size literal.
- **1.** `t73.k0.b0` — both gate literals → `0x7fffffff`, so `isOriginal` stays true. Rewriting the
  compared *value* rather than the branch keeps control flow byte-identical.
- **2.** `u13.y0` head — call an extension that re-encodes; `null` falls through to stock code. The
  fall-through target **must** be an `ExternalLabel`, not a label written inside the injected block.
- **3.** `u13.y0` — the tier-quality `iget` feeding `c1.o` → `const/16 0x50` (q80).

The extension re-derived the same `>= 20 MB || >= 100 MP` test the sites removed and returned `null`
otherwise, leaving every already-working case untouched — notably a 50 MP / 10 MB JPEG, which must
keep being copied byte for byte. Output was bounded to 24 MP via `inSampleSize` plus
`inScaled`/`inDensity`/`inTargetDensity`. The density scaler matters because `inSampleSize` alone
quantises a 126 MP source to ~7.9 MP. Rotation was baked into the pixels rather than written as an
EXIF tag, matching every other LINE encoder on this path.

**Rotation must come from LINE, not from EXIF.** `c1.f(dVar, fVar, uri, Integer rotation)` hands
the *same* `Integer` to `c1.p` (the standard variant, so the thumbnail and OBS's `/preview`) and to
the `y0` lambda. Both prefer it and fall back to the file's EXIF (`c1.d(uri)`, an `ExifInterface`
"Orientation" read) only when it is `null`. So the patch passed the lambda's `Ljava/lang/Integer;`
capture (`y0.c`) in with EXIF as fallback only: deriving from EXIF unconditionally leaves the original
sideways relative to the standard variant whenever the caller supplied a rotation the file lacks.

Sites 2 and 3 resolved `u13.c1`, its `Context` field and the lambda's captures (`c1`, `Uri`,
`Integer` rotation) **from the matched method's own bytecode**; only the two literals and framework
types were hardcoded.

## Call ringtone pipeline (investigated, deliberately not shipped)

Freeing the incoming-call ringtone from LINE's four bundled tones / paid Melody Shop tones is
**technically patchable**: the decision is entirely client-side and the playback layer already accepts
an arbitrary `Uri`. Nothing shipped — the reason is product value, not feasibility, see
[Why nothing shipped](#why-nothing-shipped). Recorded so it is not re-derived.

### The choke point

`be7.c.a(Landroid/content/Context;Lb97/c;)Lbe7/a$a;` — `public static`, `smali_classes3/be7/c.smali` —
resolves the ringtone for **both** incoming call types, called from `c97/a.java:119` (free call) and
`c97/k.java:93` (OA call). It returns one of two shapes:

| Shape | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `be7.a$a$a(ue7.a tone, be7.q fallbackFrom)` | a bundled `res/raw` tone |
| **`be7.a$a$b(be7.q, android.net.Uri)`** | **an arbitrary URI** |

The method's own MELODY branch already builds the second from a `file://` path, so URI playback ships
today — it is not theoretical.

### Playback — LINE's own MediaPlayer, in LINE's own process

`hg7.j.a()` puts the resolved tone in the RING slot (`oy.d.f261846b`) → Andromeda
`com.linecorp.andromeda.audio.s` / `t` (which unwraps the `ce7.c` wrapper back to a plain `xx.b`) →
**`xx.c.b()`**, which switches on the URI scheme:

| Scheme | How it is opened |
|---|---|
| `android.resource` | `setDataSource(context, uri)` |
| `file` | `FileInputStream(uri.getPath()).getFD()` |
| **anything else** | `setDataSource(context, uri)` — so `content://` resolves via LINE's own `ContentResolver` |

then `setAudioAttributes(USAGE_NOTIFICATION_RINGTONE)`, `setLooping(true)`, `prepare()`.

This is what makes it patchable: the URI is opened **inside LINE's process**, never handed to the
system NotificationManager, so the cross-process permission problems that sink the Google sign-in
limitation do not apply. (Message *notification* sounds are a separate system — ordinary Android
notification channels, already customisable in system Settings.)

### What actually limits users today

`be7.r$a.a()` picks the tone provider through **two sequential gates**. First a server-pushed config
int, `k97.m.m()` → `vb7.c.m()` → `t().G0().l().e()`:

| `m()` | Provider |
|---|---|
| `0`, or anything other than `1`/`2` | `DEFAULT` |
| `1` | `EMBEDDED` |
| `2` | fall through to the region switch below |

Only when it is `2` does region matter (`s87.i.a()`), and the premium branches additionally require
`a.b()` — all three of `k97.m.s()` / `.f()` / `.r()` non-empty, that is the premium-service URLs are
configured:

| Region | Provider | Ringtone setting visible? |
|---|---|---|
| JP | `MUSIC` | yes |
| TH | `FRIEND_MELODY` if `b()`, else `EMBEDDED` | only for `FRIEND_MELODY` |
| TW | `MELODY` if `b()`, else `EMBEDDED` | only for `MELODY` |
| everywhere else | `DEFAULT` | **no** |

Only MUSIC / MELODY / FRIEND_MELODY set `exposeExternalSetting = true`, which is what makes the
"Ringtones & ringback tones" entry appear. `DEFAULT` hardcodes `ue7.a.RING_1`. `EMBEDDED` resolves
through `ge7.c.e(m87.h.RING)`, reading the *legacy* melody prefs and falling back to `RING_1` when
empty. **So outside JP/TH/TW there is no ringtone choice in the UI at all** — not even among the four
bundled tones, reachable only under JP's `MUSIC` provider (it alone reads the `cf7.m` prefs). The
config int is a server-supplied *value* consumed locally, not a server-made *decision* — same shape as
the photo tier.

Two per-call overrides sit upstream of the local choice: the **caller's** friend-melody (`m87.e` on
`VoIPFreeCallIncomingConnectInfo`) preempts it, and a per-call boolean
(`VoIPFreeCallIncomingConnectInfo.t` / `VoIPOaCallIncomingConnectInfo.v`) demotes any URI-based tone
back to `RING_1`. Head-injecting `be7.c.a` sits ahead of all of this.

### Tone inventory and storage

`ue7.a` is the bundled-tone enum. Ids take the form `android.resource:///<id>`.

| Constant | `res/raw` | Title |
|---|---|---|
| `RING_1` | `original` | Xylophone (`settings_ringtone_default1`) |
| `RING_2` | `melody` | Spring |
| `RING_3` | `voice` | LINE |
| `RING_4` | `ring` | Telephone ring |
| `RINGBACK_1` | `lineapp_ringback_16k` | — |

Two parallel storage systems, both **encrypted**, and so not readable from an extension:

- **Current** — `jp.naver.voip.ringtone` via `cf7.m` (keys `ringToneUri`, `ringToneName`,
  `ringToneResourceTypeId`, `ringToneDecodedUriFlag`; accessors `cf7.p.a` / `cf7.p.b`). Built by
  `gz6.a.b`, which is `EncryptedSharedPreferences` (androidx.security `kd.b`, Android-keystore
  backed). Read only by the `MUSIC` provider.
- **Legacy LINE MELODY** — `com.linecorp.voip.melody` via `qe7.a` (keys `ringtone_path`,
  `ringtone_title`, `ringtone_oid`, …), synced from the Talk server by `ge7.c.g()`
  (`getRingToneOnTalkServer`), which **resets to default and deletes the local files** when the
  server reports no tone.

**File-playback precedent.** The LINE MUSIC path plays a plain file from LINE's *private internal*
dir — `cf7.k.b()` → `<applicationInfo.dataDir>/ringtone/decoded_ringtone_1|2` (`j48.h.d()` is
`applicationInfo.dataDir`, not external storage) — so a file in LINE's private storage plays with
**zero runtime permissions**. Purchased-track entitlement re-verifies server-side every 14 days
(`af7.g`, pref `ringToneMusicVerifyLastTime`).

### If it is ever built

Head-inject `be7.c.a` and return `be7.a$a$b(q, uri)` early when the extension supplies a URI, else
fall through. Fingerprint on anchors obfuscation cannot touch:

```kotlin
accessFlags = listOf(AccessFlags.PUBLIC, AccessFlags.STATIC)
filters = listOf(
    instanceOf("Lcom/linecorp/voip2/access/connect/VoIPFreeCallIncomingConnectInfo;"),
    instanceOf("Lcom/linecorp/voip2/access/connect/VoIPOaCallIncomingConnectInfo;"),
    methodCall(definingClass = "Landroid/net/Uri;", name = "parse"),
)
```

Uniqueness verified against 26.11.0: only three methods in the APK carry **both** `instance-of`s —
`be7.c.a` (the target), `be7.q$d.e` (excluded by `STATIC`; it is `public final`) and
`c97.m.a(Landroid/content/Context;Lb97/c;)Z` (excluded by `Uri.parse`). Filters are in program order:
both `instance-of`s precede the MELODY branch's `Uri.parse`.

Read `be7/a$a$b` and `be7/q` from the matched method's **own** MELODY branch rather than hardcoding
them — the idiom the dropped photo patch used for `u13.c1`: the `INVOKE_DIRECT` whose `name == "<init>"`
and whose `parameterTypes` end in `Landroid/net/Uri;` gives `a$a$b` as its `definingClass` and `q` as
`parameterTypes[0]`; the `SGET_OBJECT` whose field type is that `q` gives a valid enum constant. The
method is static, `.locals 5`, two params (v0–v6, `p0` = v5), so `invoke-direct`/`new-instance` stay
inside the 4-bit operand limit and v0–v2 are dead on entry.

**Any custom URI must be probed before use.** LINE declares `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`,
`READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED` and legacy `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` but **not `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`**, so
a user-added MediaStore ringtone throws `SecurityException` on open, `xx.c` swallows it and calls `c()`,
and **the call rings silently**. Probe with `ContentResolver.openAssetFileDescriptor(uri, "r")` and
return `null` on failure so LINE keeps its own tone. Stock OEM ringtones
(`content://media/internal/audio/…`, `content://settings/system/ringtone`) open with no permission.

### Why nothing shipped

- **Follow the device ringtone** (`RingtoneManager.getActualDefaultRingtoneUri`) is one small patch,
  but nobody asked for it and it silently ignores the tone of anyone whose phone ringtone is a file
  they imported themselves (the `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` note above).
- **A real in-app picker** needs a new Activity, an `AndroidManifest.xml` patch, SAF plus a copy into
  LINE's private dir, and a settings-row injection into obfuscated declarative Kotlin (`l15.c`'s
  `px4.b0` item list) whose host rows only exist in JP/TH/TW. Disproportionate to the payoff.

### Values that drift on a version bump

| Thing | 26.11.0 |
|---|---|
| resolver | `be7.c.a`; result types `be7.a$a$a` / `be7.a$a$b` |

## Google account access — two independent paths (one patched, one not)

LINE reaches a Google account by **two mechanisms that share nothing**. Establish which one a symptom
belongs to before touching anything — conflating them cost a round of wrong conclusions.

| | **Path 1 — log in / link a Google account** | **Path 2 — Drive chat-history backup** |
|---|---|---|
| Entry points | Settings ▸ Account, registration, account restore | Settings ▸ chat backup |
| LINE code | `jl0.t.a(...)` → `kl0.i` (`TYPE_GOOGLE_ID_TOKEN_CREDENTIAL`) | `ix4.a0.b(Context, Object)` |
| Mechanism | `androidx.credentials.CredentialManager` | `AccountPicker.newChooseAccountIntent` + `GoogleAuthUtil` |
| Who chooses the provider | **the system** (framework enumerates registered credential providers) | **LINE**, via a hardcoded `setPackage` |
| Patchable | **No** | **Yes** — `gmscoreauth`, device-confirmed working 2026-08-12 |

Both fail on a re-signed build for the same underlying reason: an Android OAuth client is keyed to
**(package name, signing certificate)**, so re-signing means no client matches and Google refuses
with `UNREGISTERED_ON_API_CONSOLE`.

Path 1's callers: `settings/account/LineUserAccountSettingsFragment`,
`registration/ui/fragment/EapLoginFragment`, `RegistrationMethodSelectionFragment`,
`registration/restore/ui/AccountRestoreEapLoginFragment`. The `kl0` package is LINE's third-party
identity login (it also carries `apple_login_code_result_key`), shared by Google and Apple.

### Path 1 is not patchable

LINE asks the platform for a credential. `system_server` enumerates registered providers and picks
Google's `…credman.service.GoogleIdService`. LINE never names Play Services, so there is **no package,
action or string in the APK to rewrite**, and MicroG-RE implements the *GMS* Credentials API but not
`android.service.credentials.CredentialProviderService`, so it cannot be offered as a provider either.
Device log:

```
CredentialManager(1527): Provider session created for:
    com.google.android.gms/…auth.api.credentials.credman.service.GoogleIdService
Auth.Api.Credentials: [AccountReauth_flowRunner] Flow failed.
colz: [8] Unknown error [status=UNREGISTERED_ON_API_CONSOLE].
```

Reviving this needs a credential provider added to MicroG-RE plus per-user setup — a feature in
someone else's project, not a patch.

### Path 2 is patchable — what `gmscoreauth` does

Device-confirmed end to end (LINE 26.11.0 + MicroG-RE 6.1.4, Android 16): GmsCore's picker, a
granted `drive.appdata` token, and a completed chat-history restore.

The backup flow needs exactly two things from Play Services — an account **name** and a token for it
— but reaching GmsCore for both took **five separate string sites**, each visible only after the
previous stopped failing. Expect the same if it regresses: fix one, re-test, find the next.

| # | Site | What moves | Symptom if missed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ix4.a0.b()` — `AccountPicker.newChooseAccountIntent` | picker action, `setPackage`, `allowableAccountTypes` | Google's picker appears; `UNREGISTERED_ON_API_CONSOLE` |
| 2 | `aq.a.b()` — `setSelectedAccountName` | account type **and** the `AccountManager` scan (see below) | account selected, then the picker immediately re-opens, no token requested |
| 3 | `vk.b.i()` — `GoogleAuthUtil.getToken` | the type it re-wraps the name with | GmsCore gets an account type it does not own |
| 4 | `vk.g.<clinit>` — `GoogleAuthUtil` allow-list | the `com.google` entry | request rejected client-side before any bind |
| 5 | `vk.g.<clinit>` — bind **ComponentName** | the *package* half only | `SecurityException: uid <gms> cannot get user data for accounts of type: app.revanced` |

**Site 2 needs code, not a string.** `setSelectedAccountName` resolves the picked name by scanning
`AccountManager.getAccountsByType(type)`, which can never work for a GmsCore account: since Android 8
an authenticator controls account **visibility**, and GmsCore grants it on its first `setAuthToken` —
that is, *after* a token, which needs the account to resolve first. The scan returns empty, both fields
stay null, and LINE re-prompts forever. The patch builds the `Account` directly from the name. The
scan only ever existed to turn a name into an `Account`.

Guard **both** null and empty string, branching into the original body: LINE calls
`setSelectedAccountName("")` when the backup screen opens before an account is chosen, and
`new Account("", type)` throws `IllegalArgumentException` — a crash the original avoided only because
a search for `""` matched nothing.

**Site 5 is the trap worth remembering.** `getToken` resolves no service by action at all —
`vk.g.<clinit>` builds an explicit `ComponentName("com.google.android.gms",
"com.google.android.gms.auth.GetToken")`, and an explicit bind ignores every action redirect. Move
**only the package half**: MicroG-RE ships `applicationId app.revanced.android.gms` but keeps
`namespace com.google.android.gms`, so its `<service android:name=".auth.GetToken">` really is the
class `com.google.android.gms.auth.GetToken` inside the `app.revanced` package. Rewriting the class
name too binds a component that does not exist — LINE shows a generic access error with **nothing in
the log**, because no service starts.

Everything else keeps talking to real Play Services — Maps, location sharing, ML Kit, FCM, anything
Pay touches — so the "Play Services missing" checks a wholesale GmsCore patch must defeat never fire.

Also required and easy to forget: a `<queries>` entry for GmsCore (LINE is `targetSdk 30+`, so without
it every lookup fails as "package not found"), and **not** renaming LINE's package (below).

### Redirecting one GMS client without redirecting all of them

Every GMS client extends an obfuscated `BaseGmsClient` (`kl.d` in 26.11.0) with two overridable
suppliers: the start-service **action** (`D()`) and the service **package** (`E()`). `E()` is `public`,
*not* `final`, and returns `"com.google.android.gms"` — rewriting that literal would redirect every GMS
client in the app, so give the one target class its own override instead. Resolve the supplier's name
by walking supers for the method returning that literal; `E` drifts.

### Certificate handling (device-proven)

Google **will** grant `oauth2:…/auth/drive.appdata` for `jp.naver.line.android` once GmsCore presents
the original certificate — first shown by a standalone probe, then by a real restore through the
shipped patch. Probe A/B, same account and scope:

| `client_sig` sent | Google's response |
|---|---|
| Morphe re-sign cert | `IOException: Error=UNREGISTERED_ON_API_CONSOLE` |
| LINE's original `89396dc4…` | consent flow (`AskPermissionActivity` launched) — accepted |

`PackageSpoofUtils` reads `app.revanced.android.gms.SPOOFED_PACKAGE_NAME` /
`…SPOOFED_PACKAGE_SIGNATURE` off the package being looked up. It is generic — no allow-list, no
per-app table — so **no GmsCore fork is needed**.

The order is the trap. `PackageUtils.getAndCheckPackage()` spoofs the caller's **name first**, then
`AuthManager` looks the certificate up **under the spoofed name** — off whatever
`jp.naver.line.android` is installed, not off the caller's own meta-data. So:

- If the spoofed package is absent, `getPackageInfo` throws and the code falls back to
  `KNOWN_GOOGLE_PACKAGES` (Google's apps only) → `client_sig` goes out **null**. This is why the
  ReVanced flow works for YouTube/Photos and would not for LINE.
- Thus the patch **must keep LINE's package name**. The rename the YouTube/Photos GmsCore
  patches perform would silently defeat the override.
- GmsCore targets **SDK 29**, so package-visibility filtering does not apply to it. A
  `targetSdk 30+` app needs a `<queries>` entry to see it at all.

Case matters: GmsCore's digest comes from `String.format("%02x")` and is sent verbatim as
`client_sig`, so the override is **lowercase** — the opposite of `fixpushnotifications`, which
needs the same certificate UPPERCASE because LINE's `rl.h.b` uppercases for `X-Android-Cert`.

### Class/anchor map (LINE 26.11.0)

| What | Descriptor | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Backup account picker | `ix4.a0.b(Context, Object)` | Anchored on the `drive.appdata` scope built in the same method. Strings in program order: scope, account type, picker action, target package. |
| Picker result handler | `ix4.a0.d(int, Intent)` | Reads extra `authAccount`. |
| Drive credential | `aq.a` (`GoogleAccountCredential`) | `b(String)` = `setSelectedAccountName` (scans by account type, fields `e` = Account / `d` = name); `a()` = `getToken` → `vk.b.i`. |
| GoogleAuthUtil | `vk.b.i(Context, String, String)` | `getToken(context, name, scope)`; wraps `new Account(name, type)`. |
| GoogleAuthUtil constants | `vk.g.<clinit>` | account-type allow-list + the bind `ComponentName`. `vk.g.b(Context, ComponentName, vk.f)` does the bind via `kl.k1`. |
| Backup call sites | `hx4.d.invoke(String)` → `l18.d`; `hx4.i`, `hx4.l`, `hx4.z`, `backuprestore.data.b$c`, `AutomaticChatBackupWorker` | all consume the account **name** string. |
| Auth service client | `com.google.android.gms.internal.auth.d` | `D()` → `com.google.android.gms.auth.service.START`. Inherits `E()`. |
| GMS client base | `kl.d` | `E()` = service package, `public` not `final`. **Do not rewrite its literal.** |
| Credential Manager path | `jl0.t` → `kl0.i`; wrapper `u7.*` | Path 1. Not interceptable. |
| Classic sign-in (unused) | `al.g`, `SignInHubActivity`, `gm.n` | Present in the APK but referenced only from inside the GMS library — **no LINE code path uses them**, so there is no legacy route to force. `al.g.j()`'s `GOOGLE_SIGN_IN` intent is in-app (`setClass(SignInHubActivity)`) and must not be redirected. MicroG-RE publishes no `auth.api.identity.service.signin.START`, so `gm.n` has no target either. |

If anyone ports the shared `gmsCoreSupportPatch` from morphe-patches, note two fingerprints it
hard-requires do **not** resolve against LINE: `GooglePlayUtilityFingerprint` (needs a
`MetadataValueReader` string LINE does not ship) and `ServiceCheckFingerprint` (LINE's only
`"Google Play Services not available"` match is a constructor in `gl.h`). For LINE neither is
needed anyway — real Play Services is installed, so the "GMS missing" checks never trigger.

## Dead ends (investigated, not patchable)

**Extend the unsend window.** The client windows (`j51.a.o` free, `.p` premium) are UX pre-filters fed
by server config (`function.chatroom.message.unsend.timelimit`, `.premium.timelimit`). `unsendMessage`
carries only `(seq, messageId)`. The server decides, with a dedicated `TalkException` code
`MESSAGE_NOT_DESTRUCTIBLE(71)` (`cb8.m9`) handled at `ne1.o2` / `ne1.b2` → *"You cannot unsend this
message as too much time has passed."* Widening the client window only re-shows the menu item and
produces that toast. (`hidepremiumunsend` narrows it for the same reason.)

**Remove video length / size limits.** `c81.b.c()` rejects `> 301000 ms` and `> 209715200` bytes, and
the picker sets `maxVideoDurationSec = 300` at every chat entry point. Both are trivial to remove, but
the OBS gateway enforces its own ceiling — `rc1.b` parses the `x-line-obs-talk-exception` header
carrying `EXCEED_FILE_MAX_SIZE` / `EXCEED_DAILY_QUOTA` / `NOT_SUPPORT_SEND_FILE`. Removing the client
checks trades a clean local toast for a mid-upload server rejection.

**Change the ringback tone your friends hear.** The *callee's* ringback is delivered to the **caller's**
client in their connect info and played there, so no local edit changes what a friend hears — same class
as the unsend window. (The ringback *you* hear while dialing out is client-side, `oy.d.f261845a` /
`be7.a$b`, but changing it helps nobody.) The incoming-call **ringtone** is different and *is* patchable
— see [Call ringtone pipeline](#call-ringtone-pipeline-investigated-deliberately-not-shipped).

**Log in with / link a Google account on a re-signed build.** The framework picks the credential
provider, so nothing in the APK names Play Services — see [the two-path section](#google-account-access--two-independent-paths-one-patched-one-not).
The Drive **backup** picker is a different mechanism and *is* patchable.

**Note on the OBS size ceiling for *photos*.** It has never been observed directly — the 20 MB figure
is inferred from LINE's own client-side threshold (`0x1400000`, the photo pipeline's gate), not from
anything the gateway reported. Sub-20 MB originals are known to upload byte-identical, so that much is
safe; record the real limit here if a device test ever surfaces `EXCEED_FILE_MAX_SIZE`. This says
nothing about video, whose client check is the separate 200 MB one above.
