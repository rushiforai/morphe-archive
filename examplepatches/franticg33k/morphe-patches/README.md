<summary>📦 Nepalipatro&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;2 patches</summary>
<br>

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Block Ad Server](#block-ad-server) | Stops Nepali Patro's interstitial ads. Two edits to libapp.so: the ad-only host ads-delivery.nepalipatro.com.np is rewritten to an unresolvable .xx domain of the same length, and AdsBloc::featureInterstitialAdWithHtmlPopup - the single callee behind all 24 interstitial call sites - is forced down its existing 'popup blocked' return, so the full-screen ad page and its countdown never open. The host rewrite alone is not enough: the ad URLs are also cached in SharedPreferences under PREF_SLIDER_DATA, and whether to show the page at all comes from remote config, which the app rewrites on every launch. Pairs with Remove Ads, which stops the ad content itself and the AdMob interstitials. |  |
| [Remove Ads](#remove-ads) | Disables both ad stacks in Nepali Patro: Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) and the first-party flutter_adserver HTML ad server. AdMob's method-channel entry point is short-circuited for every load and show call so no ad is ever created, and the WebView loaders the ad server uses are neutralised - loadData and loadDataWithBaseUrl become no-ops, while loadUrl only refuses the ads-delivery.nepalipatro.com.np host and data: URLs so normal in-app browsing keeps working. |  |

<summary>📦 byAir&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;2 patches</summary>
<br>

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Enable Online Pro](#enable-online-pro) | Experimental companion patch that keeps byAir's online Pro gates open without forcing the crash-prone global entitlement refresh path. |  |
| [Enable Pro](#enable-pro) | Suppresses the main byAir paywall, unlock banners, local user gating, and the notifications preferences "All" gate. |  |

<summary>📦 Hamropatro&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;1 patch</summary>
<br>

**🎯 Supported versions:**

| 10.7.33 |
| :---: |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Remove Ads](#remove-ads) | Disables all ad serving in Hamro Patro by no-oping the native ad-placement resolver (HamroAdsPlacements). Every banner, native, interstitial, fullscreen and roadblock placement funnels through these leaf builders, so returning an empty list means no ad request is ever built for the bundled MAX, Pangle, ironSource, Facebook Audience, Unity, Vungle and Google Ads SDKs, and no mediation cycle ever starts. Re-verified on v10.7.33. Works on its own, and combines cleanly with Nai64's universal No Ads patch if you have it enabled - the two act on different layers, so together they also cover the Google ads_mobile_sdk layer that no SDK-level patch reaches. |  |

<summary>📦 Provide Lite&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;3 patches</summary>
<br>

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Remove Ads](#remove-ads) | Blocks all ad display in Provide Lite by forcing the app's central ad gate (in libapp.so) to always take its 'skip' path. Two branch instructions are rewritten to unconditional skips: the global 'ad enabled' flag check (tbz -> b #skip) and the interstitial/rewarded cooldown gate (b.ge -> b #skip). Verified on v1.4.6 (Dart 3.7.0, arm64, obfuscated) — no ad-show invocation is reached. |  |
| [Remove License Activity](#remove-license-activity) | Removes the PairIP LicenseActivity and LicenseContentProvider from AndroidManifest.xml and the com.android.vending.CHECK_LICENSE permission, so the app runs without a valid Play Store license (required because the APK is re-signed during patching). |  |
| [Unlock Premium](#unlock-premium) | Patches the Dart AOT-compiled libapp.so to unlock all premium / VIP features. Forces the VIP state to always be true by rewriting the constant-pool loads (add xN, x22, #0x30 -> add xN, x22, #0x20) inside the cacheIsVipKey readers (getter + 3 callers). Verified on v1.4.6 (Dart 3.7.0, arm64, obfuscated) — flutter.cacheIsVipKey=true on device. |  |

<summary>📦 Atlas Photo&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;3 patches</summary>
<br>

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Remove License Activity](#remove-license-activity) | Removes the PairIP LicenseActivity from AndroidManifest.xml. |  |
| [Remove License Check](#remove-license-check) | Bypasses the PairIP Google Play Licensing check so Atlas Photo runs without a valid Play Store license. |  |
| [Unlock Pro](#unlock-pro) | Forces Atlas Photo's Hermes (React Native) JS runtime to treat every session as a Pro subscriber by patching the setIsProMember reducer so its isPro field is always truthy. Unlocks all Pro features and removes the Pro paywall. |  |

<summary>📦 Fricam&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;3 patches</summary>
<br>

**🎯 Supported versions:**

| 1.6.5 |
| :---: |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Remove License Activity](#remove-license-activity) | Removes the PairIP LicenseActivity from AndroidManifest.xml so the app runs without a valid Play Store license (required because the APK is re-signed during patching). |  |
| [Unlock Edge](#unlock-edge) | Unlocks the Fricam Edge feature for free. Edge is a self-hosted companion sidecar that runs beside your Frigate NVR and streams low-latency + AI-detection frames into the app over WebRTC. Unlike Pro there is no local persistence for Edge: on every RevenueCat sync the app recomputes the "fricam_edge" entitlement and publishes it into an in-memory StateFlow that drives the pairing/settings/diagnostics UI. The patch forces that published flag true so the Edge UI and the self-hosted (edge-local / Frigate-direct) routes open without a subscription. Note: Fricam's managed Cloudflare relay (edge-remote, monthly allowance) is authenticated server-side and is not bypassed - run the open-source sidecar yourself to get the full value. |  |
| [Unlock Premium](#unlock-premium) | Unlocks all Fricam Pro features for free. Fricam's Pro state terminates in a plain SharedPreferences boolean (pro_unlocked in fricam_billing) written by a single PurchaseManager writer; every UI feature gate re-reads it via the static master ProGate. Fingerprints anchor on the stable prefs keys + signatures, so they survive the R8 class/method renames between 1.3.x and 1.4.0.1. The patch forces the RevenueCat entitlement check and the master gate to always return true (layered P1+P2), hardens the persist path so no refresh can downgrade, and neutralizes the PairIP Play Store license check that gates the app on launch. |  |

<summary>📦 JellyWatch&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;2 patches</summary>

**🎯 Supported versions:**

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Remove License Activity](#remove-license-activity) | Removes the PairIP LicenseActivity from AndroidManifest.xml. |  |

<summary>📦 JellyWatch TV&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;2 patches</summary>
<br>

**🎯 Supported versions:**

| 1.0.REV-0570 |
| :---: |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Remove License Activity](#remove-license-activity) | Removes the PairIP LicenseActivity from AndroidManifest.xml. |  |
| [Unlock Premium](#unlock-premium) | Unlocks all premium features in JellyWatch TV. Premium entitlement is server-verified against verify.jellywatch.app and surfaced to the UI as a PremiumStatus data class (isPremium = first boolean field); the patch forces that field to true and neutralizes the PairIP Play Store license check that gates the app on launch. |  |

<summary>📦 NostalgiaTV&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;2 patches</summary>
<br>

**🎯 Supported versions:**

| 0.10.2 |
| :---: |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Remove License Activity](#remove-license-activity) | Removes the PairIP LicenseActivity from AndroidManifest.xml so the licensing layer can never launch the Play Store paywall, even if a license code path is reached. |  |
| [Unlock Premium](#unlock-premium) | Unlocks every client-side NostalgiaTV Pro feature by pinning the single pro state authority to true, and removes the PairIP Play Store license/paywall wrapper. All pro gating reads one StateFlow (ProStatusRepository.isProUser) that is written through one setter; the setter's argument is forced to true and the flow's initial seed is flipped to true, so the flag can never be revoked. That covers the 10-channel lineup cap, Docker companion link, on-demand library, custom themes, simulated commercials, channel editor, multiple profiles and player controls. PairIP's license check, response handling, paywall launch and error dialog are stubbed out so the app never redirects to the Play Store on launch. |  |

<summary>📦 Prismatica Pro&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;3 patches</summary>

|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Remove License Activity](#remove-license-activity) | Removes the PairIP LicenseActivity from AndroidManifest.xml. |  |
| [Remove License Check](#remove-license-check) | Bypasses the PairIP Google Play Licensing check so the app runs without a valid Play Store license. |  |
| [Remove Watermark](#remove-watermark) | Patches the procedural GLSL shader in libharwin_native.so to disable the "PRISMATICA" watermark in the video player and exported videos. |  |

<summary>📦 Karobar&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;1 patch</summary>
<br>

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Unlock Premium](#unlock-premium) | Patches Dart AOT-compiled libapp.so to unlock all premium features. Forces hasPremiumAccess and isPaidUser to always return true by NOPing their ARM64 conditional branch instructions. |  |

<summary>📦 Native Camera&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;1 patch</summary>
<br>

**🎯 Supported versions:**

| 1.4 | 1.4.2 |
| :---: | :---: |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Unlock Premium](#unlock-premium) | Forces the premium entitlement in Native Camera. Premium status is a local 'is_premium' SharedPreferences flag (in the 'rawcam_prefs' file) read on cold start into a StateFlow. Unlocks RAW DNG, 10-bit/HLG/UHDR video, custom boosted modes and the sub-40-Mbps bitrate cap. It also neutralizes PairIP's Play Store licensing (fired from both Application.attachBaseContext and LicenseContentProvider.onCreate, so a repacked copy no longer gets bounced to the Play Store paywall at launch). |  |

<summary>📦 Bolpatra Nepal&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;1 patch</summary>
<br>

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Unlock Premium, Skip Login & Make Free Trial Permanent](#unlock-premium-skip-login-make-free-trial-permanent) | Patches the Dart AOT-compiled libapp.so of Bolpatra Nepal to skip the login screen, unlock premium/paid features, and make the 7-day free trial permanent. LoginManager::isNotValidatedUser is forced to always return false, lifting the Free-plan paywall and the trial-expiry gate: the trial expiry is computed client-side from the server plan_end_date into statics (isPaid = (plan_end_date - now).inDays <= 0) that only isNotValidatedUser reads, so with it pinned to false the free trial never expires and premium features stay unlocked forever (PPMO/EGP contact redirect, hidden works tab, document download and gallery gates). The isActive() result is left honest so the app stops attaching the invalid Authorization header, and the four login redirects (notice View, document download, gallery, subscription purchase) are bypassed at the branch level so actions run straight through without sending the user to the login page. Verified on v1.1.33 (Dart 3.9.2, arm64, non-obfuscated). |  |
