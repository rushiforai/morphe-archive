| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |

<summary>📦 Provide Lite&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;3 patches</summary>
<br>

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Remove Ads](#remove-ads) | Blocks all ad display in Provide Lite by forcing the app's central ad gate (in libapp.so) to always take its 'skip' path. Two branch instructions are rewritten to unconditional skips: the global 'ad enabled' flag check (tbz -> b #skip) and the interstitial/rewarded cooldown gate (b.ge -> b #skip). Verified on v1.4.6 (Dart 3.7.0, arm64, obfuscated) — no ad-show invocation is reached. |  |
| [Remove License Activity](#remove-license-activity) | Removes the PairIP LicenseActivity and LicenseContentProvider from AndroidManifest.xml and the com.android.vending.CHECK_LICENSE permission, so the app runs without a valid Play Store license (required because the APK is re-signed during patching). |  |
| [Unlock Premium](#unlock-premium) | Patches the Dart AOT-compiled libapp.so to unlock all premium / VIP features. Forces the VIP state to always be true by rewriting the constant-pool loads (add xN, x22, #0x30 -> add xN, x22, #0x20) inside the cacheIsVipKey readers (getter + 3 callers). Verified on v1.4.6 (Dart 3.7.0, arm64, obfuscated) — flutter.cacheIsVipKey=true on device. |  |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Remove License Activity](#remove-license-activity) | Removes the PairIP LicenseActivity from AndroidManifest.xml. |  |
| [Remove License Check](#remove-license-check) | Bypasses the PairIP Google Play Licensing check so Atlas Photo runs without a valid Play Store license. |  |
| [Unlock Pro](#unlock-pro) | Forces Atlas Photo's Hermes (React Native) JS runtime to treat every session as a Pro subscriber by patching the setIsProMember reducer so its isPro field is always truthy. Unlocks all Pro features and removes the Pro paywall. |  |
