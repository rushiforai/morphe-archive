/**
 * Whether "Add microG support" is part of the patching run a patch is in.
 *
 * The patches it changes -- the removals that take the Google account out, telemetry,
 * and the package and app name -- ask with their own context object: Morphe hands every
 * patch of one run the same bytecode and resource contexts, so a run never sees another
 * run's choice, even in a Manager that patches several apps in one process.
 *
 * Morphe runs patches in name order, dependencies first, and "Add microG support" sorts
 * ahead of every patch that asks. Should that ever change, one of them would run before
 * the choice is known; each notes itself here when it goes the Ungoogled Maps way, and
 * the microG patch fails the build when it finds one, instead of shipping microG Maps
 * with its account taken out.
