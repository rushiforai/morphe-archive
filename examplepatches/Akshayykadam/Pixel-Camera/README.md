## Overview

Google introduced **"Camera Looks"** (designated internally as `sauce` and `tomte`) and customizable **"Creator Suit"** with Pixel Camera `11.0.073.972752740.32` on the Pixel 11 family. 

Through deep reverse-engineering of Dalvik bytecode and native Halide binaries, we discovered that **the complete feature framework is present across older Pixel devices**. The features were withheld exclusively via runtime feature flags and device checks.

This repository provides **comprehensive reverse-engineering research**, **device-by-device compatibility analyses**, architectural documentation on **hardware limitations & technical reasons**, and the **official Morphe patch package (`.mpp`)** to bring these features to older Google Pixel phones directly on-device without root.

---

## Key Features Unlocked

### 1. Ten Signature Camera Looks (Sauce & Tomte)
Instant tone mapping, color matrix shifts, and organic film grain encoded into captures:

| # | Look Preset | Internal Codename | Visual Characteristics |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **Original** | `sauce_default_label` | Google's classic, true-to-life HDR+ computational look. |
| **1** | **Natural** | `sauce_natural_label` | Subtle softening, neutral skin tones, restrained saturation. |
| **2** | **Shadows** | `sauce_shadows_label` | Deepened, cinematic blacks and punchy moody contrast. |
| **3** | **Vanilla** | `sauce_orange_label` | Warm, golden-hour radiance with soft ambient highlights. |
| **4** | **Editorial** | `sauce_kodachrome_label` | Rich Kodachrome-inspired magazine colors and contrast. |
| **5** | **Velvet** | `sauce_velvia_label` | High-saturation landscape tones reminiscent of Fuji Velvia. |
| **6** | **Classic** | `sauce_portra_label` | Timeless analog film aesthetic inspired by Kodak Portra. |
| **7** | **Digi** | `sauce_digicam_label` | Nostalgic early-2000s compact digital camera punch and flare. |

| **9** | **Minimal** | `sauce_minimal_label` | Clean, desaturated Scandinavian fine-art style. |

### 2. Customizable Viewfinder Quick Access Controls
* **Interactive Viewfinder Slots**: Assign **Left** and **Right** quick access slots directly from the Camera settings.
* **On-Screen Discrete Tick-Slider**: Tapping the viewfinder reveals vertical sliders—tap or scrub the 10-tick slider to switch Camera Looks in real time without opening the bottom drawer.
* **Haptic Feedback**: Tick haptics on slider detents with persistent preference storage across restarts.

### 3. Native Halide & Tomte Grain Engine
* **Native C++ Fallback**: When vendor Camera HAL tags (`REQUEST_TOMTE_TYPE`) are absent on older Tensor SoCs, native routines in `libgcastartup.so` (`wireless/android/camera/tomte/tomte_tonemap.cc`) execute on GPU and CPU.
* **Neural Style Fallback**: Fallback from TPU to CPU floating-point model (`looknet_v2.1_float.tflite`).
* **Hardware Portrait Pipeline**: Fully integrated with Google's Gouda portrait segmentation pipeline for applying Looks to portrait captures.

### 4. Pixel Camera Creator Suite
* **Creator Drawer Tab (`granite`)**: A dedicated creation tool tab in the options menu alongside General settings.
* **Teleprompter HUD (`biotite`)**: Floating viewfinder script presenter with auto-scrolling, customizable WPM speed, and Compose-based script editor.
* **Live Audio Visualizer (`mica`)**: Real-time microphone VU level indicator rendered directly over the camera feed.
* **Social Media Framing (`slate` / `basalt`)**: 9:16 vertical, 1:1 square, and custom aspect ratio composition guide overlays.
* *(See [`creator-suite-research/`](creator-suite-research/) for full documentation and patches).*

### 5. Dedicated 10x Quick Zoom Viewfinder Button
* **1-Tap 10x Super Res Zoom**: Exposes the discrete **10x** quick-toggle button on the viewfinder zoom strip alongside `0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x` on Pixel 7 Pro, 8 Pro, and 9 Pro.
* **Zero Quality Loss**: Instantly activates Google's `NativeZoomPlus` and `NativeFusionZoom` computational pipelines at a single tap without requiring manual pinch-to-zoom gestures.
* *(See [`pixel-camera-looks-research/PORTRAIT_RESEARCH.md`](pixel-camera-looks-research/PORTRAIT_RESEARCH.md) for full technical teardown).*

### 6. Pro Manual Controls Backport
* **Manual Focus & Focus Peaking**: Precision focus slider with real-time viewfinder GPU edge peaking highlights (`camera.ark_edge_hex`).
* **Manual Shutter Speed & ISO**: Full manual exposure dials with dynamic sensor range negotiation (1/8000s up to hardware limit) and instant 1-tap "Reset to Auto".
* **Live Viewfinder Readout Chips**: Real-time interactive badges over the camera feed displaying active manual exposure and focus metrics (`[1/250s]`, `[ISO 100]`, `[0.5m]`, `[Peaking active]`).
* **Hardware Camera2 Compatibility**: Operates directly through standard Android Camera2 hardware interfaces (`SENSOR_EXPOSURE_TIME`, `SENSOR_SENSITIVITY`, `LENS_FOCUS_DISTANCE`), ensuring zero reliance on proprietary vendor HAL extensions.

## ⚠️ Technical Limitations & Architectural Constraints

Running a modern Google Camera modded application without root privileges imposes physical hardware and operating system constraints. Below is a detailed breakdown of existing limitations and their underlying technical causes:

### 1. Motion Blur (Action Pan & Long Exposure) Disabled
* **Observed Behavior**: The Motion Blur mode tab (containing Action Pan and Long Exposure) is intentionally hidden and disabled from the camera mode carousel.
* **Technical Reason**:
  1. **SELinux Kernel Sandboxing (`/dev/gxp`)**: Cloned applications (e.g. `com.google.android.GoogleCameraEng`) execute in Android's unprivileged `untrusted_app` SELinux domain. Access to the Google Tensor EdgeTPU character device (`/dev/gxp` / `darwinn`) is restricted at the kernel level via DAC permissions (`0660`, `system:camera`) and SELinux MAC policy (`allow cameraserver gxp_device:chr_file`). Only system-signed, pre-installed apps signed with Google's platform release key can open or issue `ioctl()` commands to the TPU. Any attempt by an untrusted app results in `avc: denied { read write } for path="/dev/gxp"`.
  2. **Proprietary EdgeTPU Microcode (`edgetpu-custom-op-2`)**: The motion vector and saliency estimation models (`motion-custom_op-p23.tflite.uncompressed` and `saliency-custom_op-p23.tflite.uncompressed`) are compiled exclusively for Tensor's hardware TPU matrix accelerator. They utilize Google proprietary custom operators (`edgetpu-custom-op-2`) that have no CPU or GPU OpenCL fallback implementations in `libgcastartup.so`.
  3. **Capture Pipeline Hang**: Without TPU access, the native optical flow graph fails during session initialization. In user builds, this causes Action Pan and Long Exposure captures to fail silently or stall indefinitely without saving photos to disk.
  4. **Architectural Resolution**: All `camera.lasagna` flags (`kkb.f`, `kkb.g`, `kkb.h`, `kkb.i`, `kkb.j`) are intercepted in `klm.smali` (`q()` and `x()`) to return `false`. Google Camera's internal mode manager (`sdo.smali`, `njn.smali`, `iyh.smali`) cleanly prunes Motion Blur from the UI, ensuring 100% crash-free stability for all working modes.

### 2. Live Viewfinder Looks Preview (Pre-Capture)
* **Observed Behavior**: Camera Looks are applied immediately post-capture during image processing, but do not alter the real-time viewfinder feed before the shutter button is pressed.
* **Technical Reason**:
  * On the Pixel 11, Google introduced a proprietary vendor Camera HAL parameter (`REQUEST_TOMTE_TYPE`) integrated directly into the camera ISP hardware. This hardware block applies 3D tone LUTs and color transform matrices at 60 fps to the preview stream with zero computational latency.
  * Older Google Tensor processors (Tensor G1 through G5) lack this vendor HAL metadata tag and ISP preview hardware hook. Emulating 60 fps 3D LUTs in software shaders over the live viewfinder stream causes severe frame drops and thermal throttling. The mod therefore relies on Google's native Halide C++ post-capture pipeline (`tomte_tonemap.cc`), applying full-resolution, artifact-free Looks processing immediately upon capture.

### 3. Film Grain Dynamic Scaling Slider
* **Observed Behavior**: Adjusting the grain intensity slider in settings has minimal visible effect on output images.
* **Technical Reason**:
  * Native film grain generation is powered by a dedicated neural model (`3cdbac706c98421a96e16fdbfd97a35f.tflite.uncompressed`) running alongside the RAW ISP pipeline.
  * In the fallback GPU/CPU pipeline without physical `/dev/gxp` access, a consistent baseline organic film grain is applied according to the selected Look's pre-configured tone profile, but dynamic runtime variance weighting is constrained to prevent CPU cache thrashing.

### 4. Creator Suite "Save to Project" (Project Album)
* **Observed Behavior**: The "Save to Project" button in the Creator Suite drawer is neutralized and hidden.
* **Technical Reason**:
  * Project Album integration communicates with the Google Photos application via private cross-process gRPC calls (`pa_` / `pam_` in `kqc.smali`).
  * Google Photos validates the calling package identity using signature verification (`PackageManager.hasSigningCertificate()`). Because cloned mods use an independent signing certificate to coexist with stock Camera, Google Photos rejects the gRPC connection with an authorization error. Hiding the entry prevents connection errors and UI crashes.

### 5. Hardware Periscope Lens Dependency for 10x Quick Zoom
* **Observed Behavior**: The 10x Quick Zoom button requires devices with a physical optical periscope lens (Pixel 7 Pro, 8 Pro, 9 Pro, 10 Pro).
* **Technical Reason**:
  * The discrete 10x quick zoom button activates Google's Super Res Zoom and telephoto fusion pipeline directly leveraging the physical periscope telephoto sensor.
  * Base and "a"-series Pixels (e.g. Pixel 6, 6a, 7, 7a, 8, 8a, 9) physically lack a periscope sensor, operating within standard digital zoom limits.

## Generational Compatibility Matrix

Tested on physical hardware and verified through Dalvik bytecode and native binary teardowns:

| Generation | Device Models | SoC | Looks Capture | Quick Access | Pro Controls | 10x Zoom | Processing Engine | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Pixel 11** | Pixel 11, 11 Pro | Tensor G6 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Hardware TPU + HAL | **Native** |
| **Pixel 10 Series** | Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL | Tensor G5 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (Pro) | Hybrid TPU / GPU | **Verified** |
| **Pixel 9 Series** | Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, 9 Pro Fold | Tensor G4 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (Pro) | GPU / TPU Fallback | **Verified** |
| **Pixel 8 Series** | Pixel 8, 8 Pro, 8a | Tensor G3 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (Pro) | Mali-G715 GPU / Halide | **Verified** |
| **Pixel 7 Series** | Pixel 7, 7 Pro, 7a | Tensor G2 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (Pro) | GPU / Halide CPU | **Verified** |
| **Pixel 6 Series** | Pixel 6, 6 Pro, 6a | Tensor G1 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (Pro) | Halide CPU Worker | **Verified\*** |

> [!TIP]
> **\*Memory Optimization for 6GB RAM Devices (Pixel 6a / 7a)**: Continuous burst captures (>4 rapid shots) can trigger low-memory trimming. The patch limits concurrent Halide worker threads to 2 on devices with $\le 6\text{ GB}$ RAM to guarantee continuous stability.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<details>
<summary><b>Why is Motion Blur (Action Pan / Long Exposure) missing from the modes bar?</b></summary>
<p>
Motion Blur neural models rely on <code>edgetpu-custom-op-2</code> microcode running directly on Google's EdgeTPU hardware (<code>/dev/gxp</code>). Android's SELinux security policy restricts <code>/dev/gxp</code> access strictly to system-signed OEM packages; non-root modded apps (<code>untrusted_app</code> context) are blocked at the kernel driver level. Because the custom TPU operations have no CPU/GPU fallback implementations in Google's native binaries, attempting to execute the models causes optical flow processing to stall and photos fail to save. The mode has been cleanly hidden to ensure all other camera features (Photo, Portrait, Night Sight, Video, Pro Sliders, and Looks) function flawlessly.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why don't Camera Looks preview live in the viewfinder before taking a photo?</b></summary>
<p>
On Pixel 11, real-time 60 fps viewfinder tone mapping is handled by a proprietary hardware ISP extension (<code>REQUEST_TOMTE_TYPE</code> vendor tag). Older Tensor generations (G1–G5) lack this hardware ISP hook in their camera HAL. Simulating 3D LUTs in software over the live viewfinder feed causes thermal throttling and frame drops. The backport executes Google's native Halide C++ pipeline (<code>tomte_tonemap.cc</code>) during HDR+ post-capture processing, guaranteeing a smooth viewfinder and pristine full-resolution output.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Will this replace or break my stock Google Camera?</b></summary>
<p>
No. The patch clones the application into <code>com.google.android.GoogleCameraEng</code> (or <code>com.google.android.GoogleCamera.morphe</code>). The modded app installs alongside your stock Google Camera as an independent app. Both can run simultaneously, and system OTA updates will not be affected.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does this require root access?</b></summary>
<p>
Root is <b>NOT required</b>. Morphe patches the application bytecode directly and signs it with a release certificate so it installs and runs on any unrooted Pixel 6 through Pixel 10 device.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do photos taken with Looks save correctly in Google Photos?</b></summary>
<p>
Yes. Photos are written to the standard <code>DCIM/Camera</code> directory with complete EXIF and embedded <code>GFileMetadata$Sauce</code> tags, allowing Google Photos to display and backup captures normally.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What Android versions are supported?</b></summary>
<p>
Android 14 (API 34), Android 15 (API 35), and Android 16/17 previews. The Morphe patch automatically backports the <code>minSdkVersion</code> requirement from 37 down to 34.
</p>
