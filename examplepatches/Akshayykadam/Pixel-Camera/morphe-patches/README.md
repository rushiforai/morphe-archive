## 🎯 What is Morphe?

[Morphe](https://morphe.software) is an open-source Android app modification framework. Instead of downloading multi-gigabyte pre-compiled APKs from third parties, Morphe allows users to patch clean, official APKs **directly on their Android device or PC** using lightweight patch bundles (`.mpp`).

### Key Benefits:
- 🚀 **Tiny Download**: The patch package is only a few kilobytes (no 1.5 GB downloads).
- 🔒 **Zero Malware / Tampering Risk**: You download the official base APK directly from APKMirror and patch it on your own device.
- ⚖️ **100% Legal & Open Source**: Distributes only bytecode recipes, no proprietary Google binaries.

## ⚠️ Technical Limitations & Non-Root Architectural Constraints

Because Morphe patches run in an unprivileged `untrusted_app` SELinux context on non-rooted devices:

1. **Motion Blur (Action Pan & Long Exposure) Disabled**:
   - **Reason**: Motion estimation neural networks require Google EdgeTPU hardware access (`/dev/gxp`), which the Linux kernel restricts to system-signed OEM packages. Non-root apps lack DAC and SELinux permissions to open `/dev/gxp`. Since the custom operators (`edgetpu-custom-op-2`) have no CPU/GPU fallback, the mode has been cleanly hidden via `camera.lasagna` flags to ensure captures in Photo, Portrait, Night Sight, and Video never stall.
2. **Looks Applied Post-Capture**:
   - **Reason**: Live 60 fps viewfinder tone-mapping on Pixel 11 relies on a proprietary vendor Camera HAL hardware tag (`REQUEST_TOMTE_TYPE`). On Tensor G1–G5, the patch utilizes Google's native Halide C++ pipeline (`tomte_tonemap.cc`) during HDR+ processing, guaranteeing full-resolution quality with zero viewfinder lag.
3. **Creator Suite "Save to Project" Disabled**:
   - **Reason**: Cross-process gRPC calls to Google Photos require matching OEM platform signatures. The option is neutralized to prevent authorization errors.
4. **Physical Periscope Lens Required for 10x Quick Zoom**:
   - **Reason**: 10x Quick Zoom utilizes Google's Super Res Zoom and telephoto fusion. Base/non-Pro devices without a physical periscope sensor use standard zoom ranges.
