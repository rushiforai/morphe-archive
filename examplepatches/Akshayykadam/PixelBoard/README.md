## Overview

**PixelBoard** is a sleek, ultra-clean enhancement of Google's flagship keyboard. Tailored for pure productivity, PixelBoard strips away unnecessary bloatware and focuses strictly on powerhouse capabilities: **Gemini Rambler Natural Voice Dictation**, **AI Writing Assistant**, **Writing Tools V2 Gating**, **Device-Gated Inference Backend Selection**, and **Automatic Zero-Restart Instant Activation**.

PixelBoard is engineered with an independent coexistence package ID (`com.akshaykadam.pixelboard`), allowing you to install and use it **side-by-side with your factory Gboard** without replacing, uninstalling, or risking system keyboard stability.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Gemini "Rambler" Natural Voice Typing
Traditional voice-to-text transcribes every hesitation literally. PixelBoard unlocks Google's state-of-the-art **Rambler** model:
- **Speech Cleanup**: Speak naturally — stutters, false starts, and filler words (*"um"*, *"ah"*, *"like"*, *"you know"*) are filtered out in real-time.
- **Thought Completion**: Seamlessly fixes self-corrections on the fly (e.g., *"let's meet at two no, three PM"* &rarr; *"Let's meet at 3:00 PM"*).
- **Auto-Punctuation & Capitalization**: Adds context-aware periods, commas, and proper noun capitalization without requiring voice commands.
- **Multilingual Fluidity**: Mix and match languages seamlessly in a single sentence.
- **Battery-Friendly Lifecycle**: Cleanly releases speech recognition bindings (`GoogleAsrService`) as soon as the keyboard is hidden, eliminating screen-off battery drain ([#3](https://github.com/Akshayykadam/PixelBoard/issues/3)).
- **Cold Boot & Direct Boot Readiness**: Powered by Device-Protected Storage (DE), ensuring Rambler voice typing is ready immediately after device reboots without needing manual Gboard restarts ([#4](https://github.com/Akshayykadam/PixelBoard/issues/4)).

### 2. In-Line AI Writing Assistant
Access Google's Gemini-driven writing suite directly above your keys across any app:
- **One-Tap Proofread**: Correct spelling, grammatical quirks, and punctuation in an instant.
- **Tone & Style Switcher**: Rephrase sentences into *Professional*, *Casual*, *Concise*, or *Emotive* tones.
- **Smart Edit**: Context-aware editing and quick rephrasing tailored to your conversation.
- **Universal Support**: Works across all keyboard languages and input modes.

### 3. Writing Tools V2 Gating (New in v18.4)
- **Suggested Style Chips & Prompt Bar**: Unlocks Google's modern "Suggested" style chips and the freeform "Describe your edit" prompt bar.
- **Intelligent Hardware Gating**: Integrated with hardware/model eligibility checks to prevent unexpected errors or crashes on unsupported devices.
- **Dedicated In-App Control**: Toggle Writing Tools V2 on/off directly inside Advanced Settings with a clean Material You **BETA** badge.

### 4. Device-Gated AI Inference Backend Selector (New in v18.4)
On supported devices (such as Google Pixel 8 Pro / 9 series), choose your preferred inference pipeline directly under Advanced Settings:
- `GBOARD_SERVER` (Google Cloud Server Inference)
- `PRIVATE_INFERENCE_AICORE` (On-Device Private Android AICore)
- `PRIVATE_INFERENCE_ASTREA` (On-Device Astrea Framework)
- Dynamically hidden on unsupported hardware to maintain a clutter-free, native experience.

### 5. Automatic Live Activation — Zero Restarts Required (New)
- **Instant Hot-Reload**: Toggling Rambler Voice Typing, switching AI Writing Tools preferences, or changing inference backend options applies automatically in real time without restarting Gboard, force-closing the app, or rebooting your phone.
- **Zero-Friction Workflow**: Features are synchronized across the keyboard process dynamically — simply configure your desired options and start typing or dictating right away.
- **Optional Manual Reload**: Advanced Settings retains an optional Restart (`↻`) button solely as a convenience tool, but manual restarts are no longer mandatory.

### 6. Safe Coexistence & Instant Bypass
- **Side-by-Side Installation**: Installs with app label `PixelBoard` alongside stock Google Keyboard.
- **Signature Whitelist Bypass**: Pre-patched bytecode ensures Google Play signature checks and integrity verifications pass cleanly without root.

> [!NOTE]
> **Google Pixel Device Requirement**: New advanced features (such as **Writing Tools V2** and the **On-Device AI Inference Backend Selector**) are available **only on Google Pixel devices** (e.g., Pixel 8 Pro / Pixel 9 series) due to system AICore and hardware model requirements. On non-Pixel Android devices, these specific options are automatically hidden or gated to ensure complete stability, while core features like **Gemini Rambler Natural Voice Typing**, **AI Proofread**, and **Tone Rewriting** work across all supported devices.

## How to Enable Rambler Voice Typing

Follow these quick steps to activate Google's Gemini-powered **Rambler** natural voice typing:

1. **Open PixelBoard Settings**:
   - Tap the **Gear (`⚙️`)** icon in the keyboard suggestion strip, or go to Android **Settings > System > Languages & input > On-screen keyboard > PixelBoard**.
2. **Select Rambler Dictation**:
   - Tap **Voice typing**.
   - Under **Dictation type**, choose **Rambler** (switch selection from *Standard* to *Rambler*).
3. **Instant Automatic Activation (No Restart Needed)**:
   - Your selection activates automatically in real-time — **no app restart or device reboot required**!
   - *(Optional)*: You can verify that **Enable Advanced Voice Typing** is toggled **ON** under **★ Advanced settings** (enabled by default). The toolbar **Restart (`↻`)** button remains available as an optional manual fallback if ever needed.
   > [!TIP]
   > Thanks to recent runtime enhancements, Rambler dictation initializes dynamically on the fly. You can immediately tap the microphone icon without needing to restart Gboard or kill the app process!
4. **Start Speaking Naturally**:
   - Tap any text box and hit the **Microphone** icon on PixelBoard.
   - You will see the **"Just speak naturally"** setup screen.
   - Tap **Get started** and speak freely — PixelBoard handles the cleanup automatically!

  - Ensure **Show writing tools icon in suggestion strip while typing** is enabled.

### 2. Where to Access While Typing
- **Suggestion Strip (Quick Bar)**:
  - When typing in any text box across any app, the **Writing tools icon** (pen sparkle ✨) appears in the keyboard suggestion strip above your keys.
- **Keyboard Tools Menu**:
  - If the icon is hidden, tap the **4-squares / arrow icon** on the left of the suggestion strip to open the tools drawer and tap **Writing tools**.
- **Actions Available**:
  - **Proofread**: One-tap fix for grammar and spelling.
  - **Rewrite / Rephrase**: Adjust tone between *Professional*, *Casual*, *Concise*, and *Emotive*.
  - **Suggested & Custom Edit (V2)**: Tap quick suggestions or describe edits in freeform.

## 🛠️ Building & Patching

### 1. Instant 1-Click Build (100% Offline)
Place your stock Gboard APK at `input/gboard.apk`, then run:
```bash
./build.sh
```
This runs completely offline using the pre-bundled `patches/PixelBoard.mpp` and `tools/patcher.jar`. It automatically patches, aligns, and signs `output/PixelBoard.apk`.

### 2. Rebuilding Patch Bundle from Source (Optional)
If you modify any Smali or Kotlin patch code inside `pixelboard-patches/`:
```bash
./build.sh --rebuild
```
This recompiles the `.mpp` patch pack using Gradle and immediately applies it to the stock APK.

### 3. Running Test Suite
Verify patch bytecode transformations and contract integrity:
```bash
cd pixelboard-patches
JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21 ./gradlew test
```

### 4. Manual CLI Usage (Requires Java 21)
```bash
java -jar tools/patcher.jar patch \
  --patches=patches/PixelBoard.mpp \
  --options-file=options.json \
  --striplibs=arm64-v8a \
  -o=output/PixelBoard.apk \
  -r=output/patching-result.json \
  input/gboard.apk
```
