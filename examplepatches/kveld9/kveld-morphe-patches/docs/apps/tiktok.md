## ⚙️ Configurable Options in Morphe Manager

### 1. SIM Region Selector

The **`SIM Region Selector`** patch bypasses geographic content restrictions, regional feed filtering, and country-specific catalog locks by spoofing the SIM and network ISO country codes queried by TikTok.

| Option | Key | Type | Default | Range / Format | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Region** | `region` | String | `CH` | 2-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code | 2-letter ISO country code to spoof for SIM and network country checks. |

#### Region Selection Guide & Operational Trade-Offs

When selecting a region code, balance **e-commerce bloat (TikTok Shop / Mall / Live selling)** against **audio licensing and content availability**:

##### A. Optimal Baseline: `CH` (Switzerland — Default)
- **Zero E-Commerce Bloat**: TikTok Shop, shopping tabs, and affiliate product showcases are not deployed.
- **Full Music Catalog**: Complete access to commercial and international audio without local licensing mutes.
- **No EU Regulatory Overhead**: Being outside the European Union, it avoids recurring Digital Markets Act (DMA) consent dialogs and cookie barriers.
- **Unrestricted Global Feed**: Clean international feed with full upload and viewing availability.
- **Critical Distinction**: `CH` is the ISO code for Switzerland (*Confoederatio Helvetica*). Do **not** confuse with `CN` (China).

##### B. Anglo-American Trends & North American Catalog: `CA`, `AU`, or `US`
- **`CA` (Canada) / `AU` (Australia)**: Full access to North American and global trending audios with significantly less commercial push and fewer affiliate streams than the US.
- **`US` (United States)**: Maximum creator and audio catalog, but carries the heaviest native deployment of TikTok Shop, live shopping cards, and commercial anchors.
  - *Recommendation*: When using `US`, ensure `Hide TikTok Shop & Mall` and `Feed Live Stream Blocker` are activated.

##### C. Problematic Regions to Avoid

| Region | Code | Operational Issue / Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **China** | `CN` | **Total Lockout**: Mainland China uses the dedicated *Douyin* client. Spoofing `CN` causes the global TikTok client to fail server authentication and reject feed requests. |
| **India** | `IN` | **Government Ban**: TikTok services are blocked nationwide; API requests will fail to resolve. |
| **Russia** | `RU` | **Frozen Feed**: International uploads and global recommendation feeds remain suspended since 2022. |
| **Japan** | `JP` | **Muted Audios**: Stringent domestic copyright regulations (JASRAC) silence a high percentage of international and commercial tracks. |
| **Germany** | `DE` | **Audio Licensing Restrictions**: Strict music rights enforcement (GEMA) silences popular audio tracks, alongside EU regulatory consent dialogs. |
| **Southeast Asia** (`ID`, `TH`, `VN`, `MY`, `PH`) | — | **Heavy Commercial Saturation**: Primary testing ground for live commerce, floating shopping baskets, and affiliate showcases. |

##### D. Supported Region Codes (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)

The patch accepts any valid **2-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2** country code. Inputs are case-insensitive (e.g. `us`, `US`, and `Us` resolve identically).

| Region | ISO Code | Description / Feed Scope |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Switzerland** | `CH` *(Default)* | **Recommended**: Cleanest interface, zero TikTok Shop bloat, full audio catalog, no EU DMA modals |
| **United States** | `US` | Global catalog, unrestricted English feed, US creator content (pair with Shop & Live debloat patches) |
| **Canada** | `CA` | Canadian feed & North American audio catalog (less commercial bloat than US) |
| **Australia** | `AU` | Australian & Oceania feed and trending catalog |
| **United Kingdom** | `GB` | UK feed & European creator catalog |
| **Spain** | `ES` | Spanish domestic feed & European audio library |
| **Mexico** | `MX` | Mexican & North Latin American Spanish feed |
| **Argentina** | `AR` | Southern Cone Spanish feed |
| **Brazil** | `BR` | Brazilian Portuguese feed & Latin American trends |
| **France** | `FR` | French feed & Francophone catalog |
| **Italy** | `IT` | Italian domestic feed |
| **South Korea** | `KR` | Korean feed, K-Pop trends, local live streams |
| **Singapore** | `SG` | Southeast Asian English & regional catalog |
| **Japan** | `JP` | Japanese localized feed (subject to JASRAC audio restrictions) |
| **Germany** | `DE` | German feed & Central European catalog (subject to GEMA audio restrictions) |

### 2. Video Quality Governor

The **`Video Quality Governor`** patch enforces user-configured maximum resolution ceilings (`1080p`, `720p`, `540p`, `480p`, `360p`, or unconstrained) across video feeds while allowing independent configuration of download quality. While standard TikTok features like "Data Saver" only compress network transfers under cellular conditions without capping hardware decoders, this governor caps the actual rendition ladder (`bitRateList` and `SimBitRate`) parsed by PlayerKit/TTPlayer, reducing hardware MediaCodec load, thermals, GraphicBuffers memory consumption, and frame drops on lower-spec or battery-sensitive devices.

Crucially, **playback quality and download quality are decoupled**: users can browse their feed in battery-efficient 360p or 480p while downloading clean videos in full 1080p, or set a download ceiling (e.g. 720p or 480p) to conserve bandwidth and storage. Download capping directly hooks `Video.getDownloadNoWatermarkAddr()` and `Video.getDownloadAddr()` with dual H.264/ByteVC1 candidate resolution.

| Option | Key | Type | Default | Supported Ceilings | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Maximum Playback Resolution** | `maxQuality` | String | `480` | `1080`, `720`, `540`, `480`, `360`, `none` | Caps video playback height in vertical pixels. Discards higher rendition profiles in feed. |
| **Maximum Download Resolution** | `maxDownloadQuality` | String | `1080` | `1080`, `720`, `540`, `480`, `360`, `none` | Sets download resolution ceiling independently of playback, allowing high-fidelity saving. |

#### Supported Resolution Ceilings

| Option String | Resolution Height | Typical Bitrate Band | Target Profile & Resource Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `none` | Uncapped | Source bitrates | **Unconstrained**: Preserves the highest bitrate stream provided by TikTok servers without modification. |
| `1080` | 1080p | ~2500–4000 kbps | **ExtremelyHigh**: Uncapped full-HD rendition; recommended default for downloads. |
| `720` | 720p | ~1200–2000 kbps | **SuperHigh**: High-definition baseline balancing sharp visual fidelity with moderate GPU decoding. |
| `540` | 540p | ~800–1200 kbps | **H_High**: Balanced midpoint optimizing fluid 60fps feed scrolling without thermal buildup. |
| `480` *(Playback Default)* | 480p | ~500–800 kbps | **High**: Recommended sweet spot significantly reducing GraphicBuffers RAM allocation and decoding wattage. |
| `360` | 360p | ~300–500 kbps | **Standard**: Ultra-low resource profile minimizing thermal output, battery drain, and cellular data consumption. |

---

### 3. Display Refresh Rate Governor

The **`Display Refresh Rate Governor`** patch locks TikTok's window rendering frequency to peak hardware refresh rates (120Hz/90Hz) or a user-selected ceiling, neutralizing TikTok's internal refresh rate downclocking mechanisms. Under standard execution, PlayerKit lowers the window refresh rate to match video fps (typically 24–30fps or 60fps), which creates perceptible UI stutter when interacting with comments, scrolling feeds, or viewing overlays.

| Option | Key | Type | Default | Supported Values | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Target Refresh Rate** | `targetRate` | String | `max` | `max`, `120`, `90`, `60` | Select target display refresh rate. `max` queries display hardware for highest supported rate. Any value exceeding physical screen capability is automatically clamped. |

#### Hardware Query & Boundary Clamping
In `TikTokRefreshRateHook.resolveTargetRate()`, queries `Display.getSupportedModes()` (Android M+) with fallback to `Display.getSupportedRefreshRates()` to detect physical display capabilities. If a configured rate exceeds physical panel frequency (e.g. selecting 120Hz on a 90Hz or 60Hz display), it automatically clamps to `maxSupportedRate` to prevent fatal WindowManager mode switch aborts.

---

### 4. Custom Offline Videos Limit

The **`Custom Offline Videos Limit`** patch customizes the maximum video caching limit available in TikTok's native Offline Mode bottom sheet. While stock TikTok restricts offline download caching to fixed tiers (e.g. 50, 100, 150), this patch injects a user-configurable count into the options list while preserving native Keva persistence and the Auto-adjust option.

| Option | Key | Type | Default | Supported Values | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Custom Offline Videos Limit** | `customLimit` | Integer | `1000` | Any integer `1` to `50000` | Maximum number of offline videos that can be cached for offline playback. |
### 5. Custom Share Sheet

The **`Custom Share Sheet`** patch cleans and customizes TikTok's native sharing bottom sheet via granular boolean toggles. It allows disabling third-party apps (WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, SMS, Twitter, Telegram, Reddit, etc.), suppressing the direct message friends row, protecting or toggling native sharing capabilities (Repost, QR code, Copy link, System share), and hiding individual utility actions (Promote, Why this video, Duet, Stitch, PiP, etc.).

  - Hooks `Aweme.getIsCommentPostVideo()Z` -> returns `false`.
  - Flips internal `canDownload` boolean fields via reflection in `TikTokMediaHook`.
  - Hooks download action `LX/0HJb;->enable()Z` -> returns `true`, guaranteeing the Save action in the Share panel is clickable and never grayed out.
- **Clean Watermark-Free Downloads**:
  - Hooks `Aweme.getDownloadWithoutWatermark()Z` -> returns `true`.
  - Hooks `Aweme.needTTSWatermarkWhenDownload()Z` -> returns `false`.
  - Extracts clean, original `playAddr` media stream URLs, bypassing server-side watermark render queues.
- **Client-Side Watermark Neutralization**:
  - Stubs `WaterMarkServiceImpl.waterMark()` with `return-void` to prevent client-rendered overlay compositing.

### 2. Comment Customizer (`commentCustomizerPatch`)
- Consolidates comment section usability enhancements and decluttering options via compile/patch-time toggles:
  - **`commentSortControls` (default: true)**: Unlocks TikTok's internal native comment sorting controls sheet (Most Relevant, Newest, Creator Only, Media Only) by overriding `comment_sort_opt_style` configuration getter (`2`) and Aweme comment sort eligibility checks.
  - **`copyWithoutUsername` (default: true)**: Copies clean comment text without prepending the author username (`@username: `). Hooks `ClipData` builder `LIZ(String, String, List)` and BPEA clipboard helper callers.
  - **`disableSuggestedEmojis` (default: true)**: Removes the horizontal bar of suggested quick emojis above the comment input box across active keyboard and passive comment views (`ExposedEmojiPanelTrigger`, `CommentPanelFakeInput`, `CommentKeyboardModel`, `PersonalizedEmojiExperiment`).
  - **`hideCommentQuickActions` (default: true)**: Hides the quick action buttons (photo/gallery, emoji/sticker, and mention `@`) inside the comment input bar (`BaseInputAssem`, `CommentKeyboardModel`, and `TikTokCommentHook.hideCommentQuickActions`).
  - **`hideCommentSurveys` (default: true)**: Hides surveys, opinion questionnaires, and feedback cards embedded within comment lists. Neutralizes survey data item providers (`CommentSurveyDataItem`), display eligibility checks (`shouldShow`), pre-layout Lynx gates, and stubs `CommentLynxCell` view creation and binding with a GONE view.
  - **`hideStoryRings` (default: true)**: Removes profile photo story rings from avatars in the comment section. Stubs `AvatarRing.setMode` with `return-void`, rewrites `AvatarRing.draw` to pass through to `FrameLayout.draw` without rendering ring arcs, and neutralizes `AvatarRing.onInterceptTouchEvent` -> `false`.
  - **`enableVoiceComments` (default: true)**: Forces native voice comment recording buttons in comment input bars, bypassing regional rollout restrictions and remote server blocks (`audio_comment_publish`, `comment_audio_publish_entry_forbidden`, `VEAudioRecorder`).
  - **`autoTranslate` (default: false)**: Automatically dispatches batch translations for incoming comments via TikTok's native engine (`BaseCommentCell`, `CommentList.onLoaded`).

### 3. Device Privacy Guard (`devicePrivacyGuardPatch`)
> [!NOTE]
> **Bytecode-Only Privacy Architecture (`ResourceMode.RAW`)**:
> Unlike apps with standard resource structures, TikTok's entire patch suite strictly avoids resource decoding (`resourcePatch`). Re-encoding TikTok's obfuscated resource tree via `arsclib` drops launcher icon drawables (`res/a/aq2.xml`, `res/a/aq3.xml`). Privacy is enforced at the Dalvik bytecode execution layer via runtime permission interception, in-app nag suppression, sensor silencing, and telemetry neutralization while keeping APK resources intact.

- **Runtime Permission Interception & Denial Handling**:
  - Intercepts ByteDance Helios static dispatcher (`LX/02z2;->LLJ`) for `Activity.requestPermissions`.
  - Intercepts PowerPermissions headless engine (`FakeFragment;->cY` / `jT`) to immediately dispatch denials (`PackageManager.PERMISSION_DENIED`) for invasive permissions (`READ_CONTACTS`, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_LOCAL_NETWORK`, `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`, `BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`, `ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION`, `AD_ID`, `ACCESS_ADSERVICES_AD_ID`, `ACCESS_ADSERVICES_ATTRIBUTION`).
  - Resets permanent denial flags in Keva stores (`FriendsSharePreferences -> read_contact_denied = false`, `permission_store -> <perm> = false`) to prevent persistent denial profiling.
  - Hooks permission cache check (`LX/04CN;->LIZ`) returning `false` for blocked permissions to suppress permanently-denied flags.
- **In-App Permission Dialog, Settings Redirect & Location Popup Suppression**:
  - Neutralizes permanently denied system settings redirect dialogs (`LX/06WV;->LJI(Activity, String, boolean)Z` -> returns `false` for blocked permissions), eliminating persistent in-app prompts nudging users to open device Application Details Settings.
  - Suppresses relation onboarding and permission dialog triggers (`LX/16rQ.LIZJ` -> `false` for contacts, `LX/16rP.LIZJ` -> `false` for Facebook, and `LX/16rO.LIZIZ` -> `false` for permission popups).
  - Suppresses relation/contacts synchronization auth dialogs (`RelationAuthDialogControl.LJIIIIZZ` -> `false`, `RelationAuthDialogControl.LJI` -> `false`).
  - Suppresses location popups and scenes (`LX/0BK7` popup checks and `LocationServiceImpl.LJIIZILJ`, `LJIJ`).
- **Background Sync Lego Task Neutralization**:
  - Stubs background contacts sync tasks (`ContactsUploadRequest.run`, `PermissionRequestAndUploadLegoTask.run`, `IMContactInitTask.run`, `MafFollowBackBootRequest.run`).
  - Stubs background location init tasks (`InitLocationTask.run`, `InitLocationTaskHolder$Background.run`, `InitLocationTaskHolder$Main.run`).
- **Google Advertising ID (GAID) Zeroing**:
  - Hooks GAID providers (`LX/02z2;->LLLLIIL` -> `null`, `LLLLIIIILLL` -> `"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"`).
- **Universal Package Query Isolation**: Intercepts `PackageManager` query trampolines (`LX/00m8.U3`, `LX/00m8.R3`) and throws a controlled `NameNotFoundException` when external installed apps are queried, isolating app visibility without requiring resource decoding.
- **Contacts Isolation**: Neutralizes BPEA contacts reader `LX/0OFU.LIZ()` to return empty list and `LX/0OFw.LIZ()` to return a null cursor safely.
- **HAR Motion Sensor Silencing**: Injects `return -1` into `HarSensorManager` init and stubs `onSensorChanged` to stop physical movement fingerprinting.
- **Clipboard Protection**: Blocks programmatic and BPEA background clipboard reading methods (`LX/01ZZ.LIZ`, `LX/0jUy.LIZIZ`).

### 4. Bypass Screen Capture Detection (`bypassScreenCapturePatch`)
- Clears `FLAG_SECURE` (`0x2000`) on window layouts via `AntiScreenRecordController.applyFlag(enabled=false)`, `makeScreenProtection(enable=false)`, and neutralizes global Activity `FLAG_SECURE` enforcement (`setFlags(8192, 8192)`), enabling screenshots and screen recordings across restricted views, live courses, and ephemeral chats.
- Neutralizes dynamic Circle to Search and recent apps blocking: stubs `MainContentSecurityAssem` (`dispatchTouchEvent`, `rq`), neutralizes `ContentSecurityHelper` bottom navigation touch listeners (`LIZ(MotionEvent) -> return-void`, `LIZJ() -> false`), and neutralizes the `circle_search_block` experiment to prevent bottom touch interception from injecting `FLAG_SECURE` at navigation gestures (restoring Circle to Search, screen translate, music search, and recent apps preview snapshots).
- Neutralizes screenshot detection listeners, floating feedback prompts, and telemetry (`ScreenShotFeedbackService` and startup Lego tasks).

### 5. Feed Bloat & Distraction Blocker (`feedBloatBlockerPatch`)
- **Rewards Pendants Suppression**: Injects `return-void` into `SpecActWidget.bind(ViewGroup)` to prevent floating Rewards widgets (countdown coins, soccer ball stickers) from attaching to feed views.
- **Sticker & Card Stripping**: Nullifies `Aweme.getActivityPendant()`, `getCommerceStickerInfo()`, `getFloatingCardInfo()`, and `getBannerTip()`.
- **Feed Stream Purge**: Filters suggested accounts, mini-games, CapCut creation prompts, memories recaps, mini-dramas, in-feed search interest cards (card type `38`), and trending search recommendation cards (card types `34`, `35`) before UI adapter binding via `TikTokFeedAdFilter.isFeedBloat()`.
- **Community & Lynx Cards Suppression**: Neutralizes all inserted non-video Lynx cards and topic cards via `TikTokFeedAdFilter.isFeedBloat()` (`CardInsertInfo != null`, `recommendCardType > 0`), stubs `Aweme.getExploreCommunityCommentShowType()` -> `null`, and sanitizes community comment headers via `stripSurveyBloat()`.
- **Post-Video Safety Surveys & Questionnaires Neutralization**: Suppresses in-feed safety evaluation surveys ("¿Valió la pena ver este video?", feedback questionnaires, push surveys, and bottom survey buttons). Injects `return-void` into `CellSurveyComponent` (`onViewCreated`, `ur`, `wr`) and `FeedBottomSurveyButtonComponent.onParentViewCreated()`, forces `AwemeExtKt.isWithSurvey()` -> `false`, `PNSSurveyService.LIZIZ()` -> `false`, `PushSurveyAssemTrigger.yr()` -> `false`, nullifies `Aweme` survey getters (`getWithSurvey() -> false`, `getSurveyInfo() -> null`, `getSurveyInfos() -> null`, `getPersonalizedSurveyUI() -> null`, `getOnboardingSurvey() -> null`, `getPersonalizedOnboardingSurvey() -> null`), prunes standalone survey cards without media content (`hasMediaContent == false`), and strips residual survey bloat metadata on retained videos and photo mode posts (`TikTokFeedAdFilter.stripSurveyBloat()`).
- **Search Recommendation Request Neutralization**: Stubs `AbsSearchService.u()Ljava/util/List;` to return an empty list (`Collections.emptyList()`), preventing the search module from registering card insert request generators into the feed pipeline.
- **Friends Feed Rec User Cards & Bloat Neutralization**: Injects `p1 = false, p2 = false` into `FriendsV3RecUserConfig.<init>(ZZ)V` to prevent `FriendsV3FeedListViewModel` from instantiating suggested friend cards (`FriendsV3RecUserItem`) or bottom recommendation lists (`FriendsV3BottomRecListItem`). Intercepts `FriendsV3FeedResponse.<init>` to filter in-feed bloat and nullify suggested friends (`newlyShownMafIds = null`), and hooks `FriendsFeedResponse.<init>` (V2) to prune inserted card results (`cardInsertResults = null`, `insertedResults = null`). Because network responses are deserialized through the no-arg constructors, the same filtering and nulling also runs at the network boundary via `FriendsV3FeedNetworkSource.LJ` (V3) and the return points of the obfuscated friend feed request `LX/06CX;->LIZLLL` (V2); the constructor hooks remain for cached and copied responses. Injects immediate `View.GONE` and dimensions contraction (`0x0`) into `FriendsV3HorizontalRecUserCardCell.onItemViewCreated` and `FriendsV3BottomRecUserListCell.onItemViewCreated` as a fallback UI defense.

### 6. Navigation & Header Declutter (`feedNavigationDeclutterPatch`)
- Consolidates clutter removal across the feed navigation strip, top toolbar, and video bottom bars via compile/patch-time toggles:
  - **`hideNearbyTab` (default: true)**: Removes the Nearby (local city or region) feed tab from the top navigation strip. Hooks `NearbyServiceImpl.LJIIZILJ()` tab provider `LJ()` -> `null`, `NearbyTabProtocol.enable()` -> `false`, and service boolean gates.

  - **`hideTopLiveEntrance` (default: false)**: Removes the top-left LIVE broadcast button and tab entry point from the top navigation bar. Hooks `LiveIconGenerator.enabled()` -> `false`, view method -> `null`, and `LiveTabProtocol.enable()` -> `false`.
  - **`hideFeedSearchBar` (default: true)**: Removes the in-video bottom search suggestion and trending query bar. Hooks `FeedSearchBottomBarAssem` and `FeedSearchItemViewModel` trigger/binding methods to suppress bottom query pills.
  - **`hidePublishTab` (default: false)**: Removes the central `+` create / publish content button from the bottom navigation bar. Hooks `PublishTabProtocol.enable()` -> `false` and forces `View.GONE` (`0x8`) in `PublishBottomTabViewFactory.LIZ`, seamlessly redistributing the remaining 4 navigation tabs (Home, Friends, Inbox, Profile).
  - **`hideFriendsAvatarPreview` (default: true)**: Prevents friend profile pictures from replacing the Friends icon on the bottom navigation bar. Suppresses avatar fetching and ability attachment via `ISocial2TabRedDotService` (`enableTabAvatar` -> `false`, `loadAvatarAbility` -> `return-void`, `dealWithFriendsAvatar` -> `return-void`), neutralizes `BaseBottomTabAvatarAbility` and `FriendBottomTabAvatarAbility` (`isShowing` -> `false`, `cr2` -> `false`), stubs bottom tab manager view attachment and binding (`LJI`, `LJII`, `LJJJI` -> `return-void`, `LJJIIZ` -> `false`), and neutralizes the new-user exemption/reminder setting (`tt_friends_tab_avatar_exemption_new_user_days` -> `false`), ensuring the standard Friends icon remains consistently visible.
  - **`hideInboxBadge` (default: true)**: Removes the unread message counter badge and notification red dot from the bottom Messages (Inbox) tab. Stubs `NoticeCountTabBadgePresentServiceImpl` (`onResume`, `onReset` -> `return-void`, `isShowing` -> `false`), neutralizes evaluation and EventBus dispatchers on the presentation manager (`LJJIJIIJI` -> `return-void`, `onNoticeCountChangedEvent` -> `return-void`), and injects guards into the bottom Tab Manager (`LJIIL` -> forces count to 0, `LJJL` -> returns early, `LJIJJLI` -> returns 0) for the `NOTIFICATION` tab.

### 7. Feed Interface Declutter (`feedInterfaceDeclutterPatch`)
- Consolidates clutter removal across feed video cell overlay elements via compile/patch-time toggles:
  - **`hideRepostBadge` (default: true)**: Hides the repost and shared-by pill badge ('Shared by' / 'Reposted') above creator details on feed videos. Hooks `UpvoteVideoTrigger.yr(VideoItemParams)Z` -> returns `false`, preventing `UpvoteVideoAssemNew` from being attached or activated. Stubs `UpvoteVideoAssemNew` methods (`tr`/`hb` -> `false`, `LLLLIILL`/`LLILZ`/`z4` -> `return-void`, `onViewCreated` -> `View.GONE`).
  - **`hideVideoDescriptions` (default: true)**: Hides video descriptions, captions, hashtags, "more" expansion buttons, and the "See translation" interactive button across feed videos while keeping creator and author info intact. Enforces `View.GONE` (`0x8`) in `VideoDescAssem.onViewCreated`, stubs `z4`/`js` to prevent text binding, neutralizes `FriendsV3DescAssem`, and neutralizes `TranslationControlsAssem` and `TranslationStatusAssem` to eliminate leftover translation action buttons.
  - **`hideAvatarFollowButton` (default: true)**: Hides the red plus (`+`) follow badge on creator profile avatars in the feed and eliminates accidental follow touches. Hooks `FeedAvatarDefaultAssem.Qr(ViewGroup, int, Object)` -> permanently sets visibility to `View.GONE` (`0x8`) and disables clickability via `TikTokMediaHook.hideFollowButton`. Injects immediate `View.GONE` into `FeedAvatarDefaultAssem.onViewCreated` right after `LLLIILIL` (`follow_view_container`) is assigned.
  - **`disableStoryRings` (default: true)**: Removes creator profile photo story rings from feed videos, ensuring avatar photos remain clean without blue story rings. Hooks `User.getStoryStatus()I` -> `0`, stubs `FeedAvatarSocialPublishAssem` lifecycle methods (`onViewCreated`, `onBind`, `tr`) with `return-void` to remove story indicators and click interceptors, and hooks `SocPubDistributeServiceImpl` -> `false`.
  - **`hidePlaylistBar` (default: true)**: Hides the playlist indicator bar displayed above bottom navigation when a video is part of a playlist.

### 8. Disable Profile Photo LIVE Status (`disableAvatarLiveStatusPatch`)
- Removes the pulsing LIVE ring animation and LIVE badge from creator avatars in the feed and ensures avatar taps route strictly to the creator's user profile instead of launching the live stream broadcast.
- Dynamically locates and hooks the author live validator (`LX/09A7;->LIZIZ(Aweme, User)Z`) -> returns `false`.
- Hooks `FeedAvatarAssemWrap.Yr()Z` -> returns `false`, preventing the attachment and lifecycle execution of `FeedAvatarLiveAssem`.
- Hooks `FeedAvatarLiveAssem.ur()Z` -> returns `false`.
- Stubs `FeedAvatarLiveAssem.Ar(ZZ)V` and `FeedAvatarLiveAssem.onBind(Object)V` with `return-void` to eliminate live streaming UI bindings and animations.
- Preserves `FeedAvatarDefaultAssem`'s default avatar click handler (`LX/0BIx`), routing taps directly to `//user/profile`.

- **Multi-Vector AI Metadata Inspection**: Inspects `Aweme` for:
  - `AIGCInfo` (`AIGCLabelType != 0`, `createByAI == true`).
  - `ModerationAigcInfo` (`moderationAigcLabelType != 0`, `moderationUserLabelStatus != 0`, `creatorGuidanceStatus != 0`, `moderationCreatorSegment` populated).
  - `C2PAInfo` (`aigcSrc`, `firstAigcSrc`, `lastAigcSrc` populated).
  - Specific AI sub-structures (`aiAliveInfo`, `aiPortraitInfo`, `aiRemixInfo`, `aiTheaterInfo`, `aiChatEditorInfo`).
  - Native AI banners and anchors (`ANCHOR_AIGC`, Lynx AI disclosure templates).

- **Mutual Follow & Suggested Tag Inspection**:
  - Validates `author.getFollowStatus() == 2` (mutual friends who follow each other). If the author is not a mutual friend (`followStatus != 2`), the video is pruned from playback.
  - Detects and prunes suggested accounts via `User.getMatchedFriendStruct()`, `User.isMatchedFriendAvailable()`, and `User.getRecType()`.
  - Prunes videos tagged with recommendation relation labels (`Aweme.getFeedRelationLabel()`, `getRelationLabel()`, `getRelationRecommendInfo()`, and `getRecReasonsStruct()`).
  - For reposts (`FriendsV3RepostModel`), inspects the `reposter` user profile: ensures `reposter.getFollowStatus() == 2` and filters out suggested reposter accounts.
  - Automatically preserves user's own uploads and self-reposts by verifying `author.getUid()` / `reposter.getUid()` against the logged-in user (`IUserService.getCurrentUserID()`).

### 15. Disable Search Video Autoplay (`disableSearchVideoAutoplayPatch`)
- Disables automatic video and media playback in TikTok search results, preserving bandwidth and preventing unwanted audio or distraction while browsing search cards.
- **Search List Autoplay Calculation Loop Suppression**: Injects `return-void` at index 0 of `SearchListAutoplayHelper.LIZIZ(Z LX/0JHH;)V` (fingerprinted by string `"checkLogic() is not called on main thread"`), halting the recurring scroll and idle candidate evaluation cycle.
- **Card AutoPlay Ability Inactivation**: Injects `const/4 v0, 0` / `return v0` into `SearchCardVideoPlayerAssem$autoPlayAbility$2$1.l2()Z`, `SearchVideoForLynx$ability$1.l2()Z`, and `SearchCardPhotoPlayerAssem$autoPlayAbility$2$1.l2()Z`, asserting `false` for card autoplay eligibility.
- **Playback Execution Guard**: Injects `return-void` into `r()V` on all search card `AutoPlayAbility` implementations, preventing any direct invocation from triggering video playback or hiding cover thumbnails. Detail view playback when opening a video remains fully functional via `PlayerController`.

### 16. Resume Video After Scroll (`resumeVideoAfterScrollPatch`)
- Persists and restores playback timestamp when scrolling away and returning to feed videos.
- **Configuration Gate Activation**: Hooks `FeedPlayProgressContinueConfig` gate (`invoke()`), forcing `enable = true`.
- **Feed Type Restriction Bypass**: Intercepts the event type check matching `landscape_change_keep_tag`, replacing the `MOVE_RESULT` register with `1` to allow timestamp restoration across standard vertical portrait feeds.

### 17. Stop Video Looping (`stopVideoLoopingPatch`)
- Prevents videos from repeating in an infinite loop upon playback completion.
- **Native Player Looping Suppression**: Injects `const/4 p1, 0x0` at instruction offset 0 of `Lcom/ss/ttvideoengine/TTVideoEngine;->setLooping(Z)V`, ensuring `isLooping` remains disabled for the underlying media session.

### 18. Hide Seen Videos (`hideSeenVideosPatch`)
- Automatically filters previously watched videos from incoming For You feed batches, preventing repeat content during the session while preserving active viewing history.
- **Playback Tracking**: Hooks `PlayerController.onPlayProgressChange(String, long, long)` (recording videos viewed for >= 5s or >= 70% duration) and `PlayerController.onPlayCompleted(String)`.
- **Network Ingestion Filtering**: Hooks `FeedApiService.fetchFeedList()` return points, pruning seen video entries directly from deserialized `FeedItemList` payloads before they are delivered to the UI layer, preventing adapter desynchronization and frame drops.

### 19. Disable Post-Download Share Dialog (`disablePostDownloadDialogPatch`)
- Suppresses the automatic 'Share to' and friend suggestions bottom sheet that pops up after finishing a video or media download.
- **Bottom Sheet Presentation Neutralization**: Stubs the popup display launcher in `DownloadAndShareFragment` (fingerprinted by `definingClass = DownloadAndShareFragment` and string `"after_video_saved_share_to_nscreen"`) with `return-void` at instruction offset 0, preventing the creation and display of the `TuxSheet` bottom sheet dialog while preserving download completion toasts and saved file integrity.

### 20. Hide Inbox Story & Status Tray (`hideInboxStoryTrayPatch`)
- Removes the horizontal story carousel, status notes, and creation bubbles (Skylight) displayed at the top of the direct messages inbox.
- **Skylight Widget Injector Suppression**: Hooks `InboxSkylightWidgetV2Injector.enable()Z` -> returns `false`, preventing the Skylight container from registering or injecting into the inbox multi-pod recycler.
- **Combine Pod Provider Neutralization**: Stubs `InboxSkylightWidgetV2.Sq()Ljava/util/List;` -> returns `emptyList()`, neutralizing story and thought combine pod creation.
- **Eligibility Gate Neutralization**: Hooks `InboxSkylightWidgetV2.er(List)Z` -> returns `false`, ensuring display eligibility checks evaluate to empty.

### 21. Disable Feed Long-Press Actions (`disableFeedLongPressActionsPatch`)
- Disables long-press action gestures on feed buttons, eliminating unwanted menu popups while preserving standard single-tap actions.
- **Configurable Options**:
  - `disableLikeRepost` (default: `true`): Prevents long-pressing the Like (heart) button from opening TikTok's Repost action panel. Hooks `VideoDiggAssem.Sr(View)Z` to consume the long-press gesture (`return true`) without triggering the repost panel or falling through to click. Single tap to like or unlike remains fully functional.
  - `disableShareQuickDms` (default: `true`): Prevents holding the Share button from launching the quick-share recent contacts tray. Overrides the `im_long_press_share_button_to_quick_share` configuration lambda to return `0` (`Integer.valueOf(0)`) and neutralizes the `ShareUnreadVideoQuickDMTrigger` eligibility check -> returns `false`. Single tap to open the full share sheet remains fully functional.
  - `disableCommentReactions` (default: `true`): Prevents long-pressing the Comment button from opening the quick emoji reaction picker. Overrides the `long_press_quick_comment` configuration lambda to return `0` (`Integer.valueOf(0)`), causing `VideoCommentAssem.Kr()` and `Lr()` to attach only the native single-tap `OnClickListener` without long-press touch listeners. Single tap to open comments remains fully functional.

### 22. Enable Profile Banner (`profileBannerPatch`)
- Unlocks the custom profile banner (background header cover) feature on user profiles and enables the banner selection, cropping, and editing tools in Edit Profile.
- **ProfileBackgroundExp Gate Activation**: Hooks the main feature evaluation gate in `ProfileBackgroundExp` (`(Z)Z`) -> returns `true`, allowing `MusProfileEditFragment` to attach `ProfileBgEditHelper` (`LX/0axG`) and `ProfileRootBaseComponent` to assemble the `ProfileBackgroundComponent`.

### 23. Direct Message Declutter (`directMessageDeclutterPatch`)
- Declutters direct message chat rooms and the inbox conversation list via modular boolean toggles:
  - **Chat List Camera Icon (`hideChatListCamera`)**: Hooks the serialized view configuration model `LX/0CbL;` in its `<init>` constructors and `setShowCameraIcon(Z)V` to enforce `showCameraIcon = false`, removing the camera shortcut on conversation list rows.
  - **Header Call Button (`hideCallButton`)**: In `BaseSingleChatTitleBarRightAssem.onViewCreated(View)V`, sets the call icon view (`0x7f0a39ae` / `icon_call_container`) to `View.GONE` and sets field `LLLFF` to `null` to neutralize async observer callbacks without crashing.
  - **Message Forward Button (`hideMessageForwardButton`)**: In `SideMessageStatusReusedSkeletonUISlot;->vs(LX/0BVS;)LX/0pxs;`, substitutes return value `LX/0pxs;->FORWARD` with `LX/0pxs;->NOTHING`, suppressing the forward arrow button beside individual chat messages while keeping the reply button functional.
  - **Reaction & Streak Mascot Bar (`hideReactionTray`)**: Hooks `ActionBarServiceImpl;->LJI()Z` to return `false` (neutralizing feature eligibility) and injects `View.GONE` into `ActionBarUIAssem.onViewCreated(View)V` immediately prior to `return-void`, hiding the emoji reaction bar and streak mascot.
  - **Input Camera Shortcut (`hideInputCamera`)**: Hooks `DMCameraFeatureImpl;->LJII(...)` to return `null` and suppresses container `0x7f0a479c` (`input_camera_container`) with `View.GONE` in `IMInputAssem.onViewCreated(View)V`.
  - **Right Input Action Buttons (`hideGalleryButton`, `hideEmojiButton`, `hideVoiceRecordButton`)**:
    - **Photo Album / Gallery**: Sets `0x7f0a3d4f` (`im_photo_btn`) to `View.GONE` and returns early in `IMImageBtnViewAssem.Wr(View)V`.
    - **Stickers & Emojis**: Sets `0x7f0a3ce0` (`im_emoji_btn`) to `View.GONE` and returns early in `InputEmojiButtonUIAssem.onViewCreated(View)V`. For the redesigned input bar layout (`ui_slot_input_layout_redesign`), forces the `InputIconBtn` `EMOJI_BTN` slot view (`0x7f0a3aba` / `kwq`) to 0x0 dimensions (`width = 0`, `height = 0`), strips margins (`setMarginEnd(0)`), disables click and touch interactions (`setClickable(false)`, `setEnabled(false)`), scaled to 0 (`setScaleX(0f)`, `setScaleY(0f)`), and sets `View.GONE` directly in its setup lambda built by `LX/0YEc;->LIZ`.
    - **Voice Record**: Sets `0x7f0a4980` (`record_btn`) to `View.GONE` and returns early in `RecordBtnAssem.onViewCreated(View)V`.
    - *Preservation Invariant*: The parent actions container `0x7f0a3dd3` (`im_input_right_container`) is intentionally left intact so that `SendButtonAssemV2` appears seamlessly when typing text.
  - **Try Effect CTA Button (`hideTryEffectButton`)**: Hooks both static eligibility gate methods in obfuscated gate class `LX/0qRQ;` (`LIZIZ(...)Z` called by `AwemeCardAssem` and `LIZJ(...)Z` called by CTA list builders `LX/0qPi`/`LX/0qPj` before instantiating `TryEffectCTAButtonType` / `LX/0YK6;`) to return `false`, neutralizing the 'Try effect' camera shortcut button on shared videos in direct messages.
  - **Sticker Reply Suggestions (`hideStickerReplySuggestions`)**: Neutralizes sticker suggestion popups and reply banners in direct messages:
    - **Incoming Reply Suggestions**: In `ReplyToStickerRecommendationViewModel`, hooks the static synthetic default-args dispatcher method (`y83(...)V`) by injecting a bitmask check on register `p3` at instruction offset 0 (`and-int/lit8 v0, p3, 0x2`). When called by automatic triggers without a message argument (mask contains bit `0x2`), it returns early (`return-void`), suppressing the automatic 'Tap a sticker to reply' suggestion panel above the text input bar while preserving manual sticker replies initiated via the sticker reply button (mask `0x1`).
    - **Preshown Reply Banner**: Hooks `PreshownStickerBannerProtocol.isEnabled()Z` -> `false` and converts `PreshownStickerBannerProtocol.intercept(List)List` to passthrough `return-object p1`, preventing the bottom conversation banner from instantiating.
    - **Typing Recommendations**: Hooks `TypingRecommendationPanelAssem.Kq()Z` -> `false` and stubs the typing strip pipeline `Aq(LX/0XIS;)V`, `Rq(LX/0pPl;)V`, `Sq(List;)V`, `rq(LX/0pPl;)V` and `uq(LX/0pPl;)V` with `return-void`, suppressing the typing-triggered sticker/GIF strip above the input bar.

### 24. Popups & Prompts Suppressor (`popupsAndPromptsSuppressorPatch`)
- Suppresses intrusive modal popups, bottom sheets, overlay takeovers, and nudge reminders via modular boolean toggles:
  - **Account & Permission Nags (`suppressAccountPrompts`)**:
    - Stubs `RecUserPopupInMainActivityController.LIZLLL()V` with `return-void` to prevent the "Follow your friends" recommendation dialog on startup and navigation.
    - Stubs `LX/0YL4;->LJII(...)V` with `return-void` to suppress "Get notifications from other accounts" prompts when switching accounts.
    - Suppresses the "Find contacts" sync overlay on the Friends tab by stubbing `LX/0v6A;->canShow()Z` -> `false`, `LX/0v6A;->LJII(...)V` -> `return-void`, and `RelationAuthDialogControl;->LJFF(...)V` -> `return-void`.
    - Suppresses 2-Step Verification security checkup popups by intercepting `LocalCampaignManager.showLocalCampaign` (`"UPSELL_2SV_POPUP"`) -> `false` and `PopSuiteManagerService.shouldShowPopSuitePopup` -> `false`.
  - **Sticker Recommendations (`suppressStickerRecommendations`)**:
    - Disables sticker typing recommendations in direct messages by intercepting `ChatFeatureListConf.featureEnable` -> `false` when queried for `TYPING_RECOMMEND`.
  - **PopLayer Prompts & Nags (`filterPopLayerPrompts`)**:
    - Hooks `LX/07Q5;->canShow()Z` (`PopLayerBaseFragment.canShow`) to check against companion extension hook `TikTokPopupHook.shouldSuppressPopLayer()`.
    - Blocks 18 targeted PopLayer labels and triggers: favorites collections guide, add shortcut nag, repost newbie guide, STEM feed prompt, campus education sheet, creator inbox guide, in-app review prompt, marketing/email opt-ins, FYP survey dialogs, CapCut upsell sheets, Lemon8 promo modals, profile visitor prompts, and story introduction sheets.
  - **Live Stream Teaser Bubble (`suppressLiveTeaserBubble`)**:
    - Suppresses floating live stream preview teaser bubbles over feed videos by stubbing `LiveBubbleUtil.LIZ` -> `return-void` and forcing `LiveBubbleUtil.LJIIIIZZ` -> `false`.
  - **DM Streak Reminders (`suppressStreakReminders`)**:
    - Neutralizes streak expiration urgency alerts and inline reminder messages in direct messages by forcing `LX/0O2v;->LIZ` (`has_streak_reminder_inline_msg`) -> `false`.

### 25. Update Prompt Suppressor (`disableInAppUpdateNagsPatch`)
- Neutralizes background update polling tasks and device ID check routines to prevent forced update popups.
- Stubs `run()V` on `CheckUpdateChangeDeviceIDTaskHolder$Background`, `CheckUpdateChangeDeviceIDTaskHolder$BootFinish`, and cold startup task `CheckUpdateChangeDeviceIDTask` with `return-void`.

### 26. Disable HDR Video Playback (`disableHdrVideoPatch`)
- Forces the video playback engine to select standard SDR bitrates (BT.709/sRGB) instead of HDR (HDR10/PQ/HLG), preventing blinding screen brightness spikes and display thermal throttling while preserving smooth playback.
- Stubs `isForceHdrOff()Z` -> `true` across all `ISimPlayerConfig` and `PlayerConfigImpl` implementations to trigger PlayerKit's native HDR rendition filter.
- Stubs `SimVideoUrlModel.isHaveHdr()Z` -> `false` and `SimBitRate.isHdr()Z` -> `false` to ensure player models report streams strictly as standard dynamic range.
