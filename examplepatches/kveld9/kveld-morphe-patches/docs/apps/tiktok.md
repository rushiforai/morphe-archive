## ⚙️ Configurable Options in Morphe Manager

### 1. SIM Region Selector

The **`SIM Region Selector`** patch bypasses geographic content restrictions, regional feed filtering, and country-specific catalog locks by spoofing the SIM and network ISO country codes queried by TikTok.

| Option | Key | Type | Default | Range / Format | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Region** | `region` | String | `CH` | 2-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code | 2-letter ISO country code to spoof for SIM and network country checks. |
| **Operator Numeric** | `operatorNumeric` | String | _(empty)_ | 5-6 digits (MCC+MNC, e.g. `22801`) | Numeric operator code spoofed at every TelephonyManager operator and CellIdentity MCC/MNC call site. Empty keeps stock values. |
| **Operator Name** | `operatorName` | String | _(empty)_ | Carrier display name | Name reported for SIM/network operator queries. Empty keeps the stock name. |

#### Region Selection Guide & Operational Trade-Offs

When selecting a region code, balance **e-commerce bloat (TikTok Shop / Mall / Live selling)** against **audio licensing and content availability**:

##### A. Optimal Baseline: `CH` (Switzerland — Default)
- **Zero E-Commerce Bloat**: TikTok Shop, shopping tabs, and affiliate product showcases are not deployed.
- **Full Music Catalog**: Complete access to commercial and international audio without local licensing mutes.
- **No EU Regulatory Overhead**: Being outside the European Union, it avoids recurring Digital Markets Act (DMA) consent dialogs and cookie barriers.
- **Unrestricted Global Feed**: Clean international feed with full upload and viewing availability.
- **Critical Distinction**: `CH` is the ISO code for Switzerland (*Confoederatio Helvetica*). Do **not** confuse with `CN` (China).

##### B. Anglo-American Trends & North American Catalog: `CA`, `AU`, or `US`
- **`CA` (Canada) / `AU` (Australia)**: Full access to North American and global trending audios with significantly less commercial push and fewer affiliate streams than the US.
- **`US` (United States)**: Maximum creator and audio catalog, but carries the heaviest native deployment of TikTok Shop, live shopping cards, and commercial anchors.
  - *Recommendation*: When using `US`, ensure `Hide TikTok Shop & Mall` and `Feed Live Stream Blocker` are activated.

##### C. Problematic Regions to Avoid

| Region | Code | Operational Issue / Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **China** | `CN` | **Total Lockout**: Mainland China uses the dedicated *Douyin* client. Spoofing `CN` causes the global TikTok client to fail server authentication and reject feed requests. |
| **India** | `IN` | **Government Ban**: TikTok services are blocked nationwide; API requests will fail to resolve. |
| **Russia** | `RU` | **Frozen Feed**: International uploads and global recommendation feeds remain suspended since 2022. |
| **Japan** | `JP` | **Muted Audios**: Stringent domestic copyright regulations (JASRAC) silence a high percentage of international and commercial tracks. |
| **Germany** | `DE` | **Audio Licensing Restrictions**: Strict music rights enforcement (GEMA) silences popular audio tracks, alongside EU regulatory consent dialogs. |
| **Southeast Asia** (`ID`, `TH`, `VN`, `MY`, `PH`) | — | **Heavy Commercial Saturation**: Primary testing ground for live commerce, floating shopping baskets, and affiliate showcases. |

##### D. Supported Region Codes (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)

The patch accepts any valid **2-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2** country code. Inputs are case-insensitive (e.g. `us`, `US`, and `Us` resolve identically).

| Region | ISO Code | Description / Feed Scope |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Switzerland** | `CH` *(Default)* | **Recommended**: Cleanest interface, zero TikTok Shop bloat, full audio catalog, no EU DMA modals |
| **United States** | `US` | Global catalog, unrestricted English feed, US creator content (pair with Shop & Live debloat patches) |
| **Canada** | `CA` | Canadian feed & North American audio catalog (less commercial bloat than US) |
| **Australia** | `AU` | Australian & Oceania feed and trending catalog |
| **United Kingdom** | `GB` | UK feed & European creator catalog |
| **Spain** | `ES` | Spanish domestic feed & European audio library |
| **Mexico** | `MX` | Mexican & North Latin American Spanish feed |
| **Argentina** | `AR` | Southern Cone Spanish feed |
| **Brazil** | `BR` | Brazilian Portuguese feed & Latin American trends |
| **France** | `FR` | French feed & Francophone catalog |
| **Italy** | `IT` | Italian domestic feed |
| **South Korea** | `KR` | Korean feed, K-Pop trends, local live streams |
| **Singapore** | `SG` | Southeast Asian English & regional catalog |
| **Japan** | `JP` | Japanese localized feed (subject to JASRAC audio restrictions) |
| **Germany** | `DE` | German feed & Central European catalog (subject to GEMA audio restrictions) |

### 2. Video Quality Governor

The **`Video Quality Governor`** patch enforces a user-configured maximum playback resolution ceiling (`1080p`, `720p`, `540p`, `480p`, `360p`, or unconstrained) across video feeds. While standard TikTok features like "Data Saver" only compress network transfers under cellular conditions without capping hardware decoders, this governor caps the actual rendition ladder (`bitRateList` and `SimBitRate`) parsed by PlayerKit/TTPlayer, reducing hardware MediaCodec load, thermals, GraphicBuffers memory consumption, and frame drops on lower-spec or battery-sensitive devices.

Coverage includes the detail page: hooks on `Video.getPlayAddr()` / `getProperPlayAddr()` (plus codec variants `getPlayAddrBytevc1()`, `getPlayAddrH264()`, `getH264PlayAddr()`) and `SimVideoUrlModel.getRawBitRate()` enforce the cap on directly-read play addresses, which the detail view reaches without passing through `Aweme.getVideo()`. Enforcement resolves the best stream at or below the cap from the video's own ladder and rewrites the returned URL model in place; when the ladder offers no stream below the cap, the lowest available stream is kept.

Download quality is **not** configured here: it lives solely in the Media Usability patch (`downloadQuality`: `high`/`medium`/`low` or a `1080`/`720`/`540`/`480`/`360` ceiling), which always wins for saved files. (The former `maxDownloadQuality` option was retired for exactly this reason: one place for download quality.)

| Option | Key | Type | Default | Supported Ceilings | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Maximum Playback Resolution** | `maxQuality` | String | `480` | `1080`, `720`, `540`, `480`, `360`, `none` | Caps video playback height in vertical pixels. Discards higher rendition profiles in feed. |
| **Avoid ByteVC2 Software Decoding** | `avoidByteVC2` | Boolean | `true` | `true`, `false` | Drops ByteVC2 renditions when an H.264 or ByteVC1 alternative exists, forcing hardware decoding. |
| **Drop Undecodable Video Streams** | `dropUndecodableVideo` | Boolean | `true` | `true`, `false` | When the ladder floor exceeds the hardware decoder, keeps audio-only instead of decoder-reject retry loops. |

ByteVC2 is ByteDance's proprietary codec with no hardware decoder, so TikTok decodes it on the CPU. Dropping it lets H.264/ByteVC1 renditions play through the hardware MediaCodec decoder. As a trade-off, ByteVC1 and H.264 renditions are larger, so mobile data usage can increase slightly; if a video only offers ByteVC2, it is kept.

Measured A/B on a Moto G56 (Dimensity MT6855G, TikTok 47.1.4, 15 feed videos per arm, same build except the flag):

| Metric | avoidByteVC2 on | avoidByteVC2 off |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ByteVC2 renditions dropped | 4 | 0 |
| ByteVC2 software decoder instances created | 0 | 2 |
| Hardware (ByteVC1) decode lines | 24 | 28 |
| Software VDecod threads observed | none | VDecod2-V15/V16 active |
| Crashes | 0 | 0 |

Caveat: per-core CPU delta was not rigorously measured (point samples, different content per arm); the historical ~0.6 CPU cores per video figure comes from a Snapdragon 636 baseline, not from this test.

Undecodable guard: stream dimensions are resolved from bitrate metadata and compared against the largest long side reported by `MediaCodecList` for the stream codec family (`video/hevc` for ByteVC1/HEVC, `video/avc` otherwise). No orientation is assumed: any single known side above the hardware maximum already proves undecodability. When ladder entries hide their own size, the parent `Video` dimensions (authoritative server metadata) are used as fallback. When even the lowest ladder rendition exceeds it (e.g. `2160x3840` on a decoder topped at `2560x1440`, observed as `C2MtkVdec: BAD VALUE: Resolution not supported` retry loops), video streams are dropped and the audio track is preserved so playback fails fast instead of freezing the device. ByteVC2 is excluded (dedicated CPU decoder) and unknown dimensions or hardware fail open (ladder kept).

Single-rendition 4K limitation: when a video exposes only one rendition above both the playback cap and the hardware decoder capability (observed: 2160x3840 HEVC Main 10 HLG on a decoder topped at 2560x1440, C2MtkVdec BAD VALUE retry loop ending in TikTok's couldn't play this video error), no client-side patch can conjure the missing lower renditions. The Governor still protects every other video in feed, search, profile, and detail pages; this ladder shape remains unplayable on the affected device.

#### Supported Resolution Ceilings

| Option String | Resolution Height | Typical Bitrate Band | Target Profile & Resource Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `none` | Uncapped | Source bitrates | **Unconstrained**: Preserves the highest bitrate stream provided by TikTok servers without modification. |
| `1080` | 1080p | ~2500–4000 kbps | **ExtremelyHigh**: Uncapped full-HD rendition; recommended default for downloads. |
| `720` | 720p | ~1200–2000 kbps | **SuperHigh**: High-definition baseline balancing sharp visual fidelity with moderate GPU decoding. |
| `540` | 540p | ~800–1200 kbps | **H_High**: Balanced midpoint optimizing fluid 60fps feed scrolling without thermal buildup. |
| `480` *(Playback Default)* | 480p | ~500–800 kbps | **High**: Recommended sweet spot significantly reducing GraphicBuffers RAM allocation and decoding wattage. |
| `360` | 360p | ~300–500 kbps | **Standard**: Ultra-low resource profile minimizing thermal output, battery drain, and cellular data consumption. |

### 3. Display Refresh Rate Governor

The **`Display Refresh Rate Governor`** patch locks TikTok's window rendering frequency to peak hardware refresh rates (120Hz/90Hz) or a user-selected ceiling, neutralizing TikTok's internal refresh rate downclocking mechanisms. Under standard execution, PlayerKit lowers the window refresh rate to match video fps (typically 24–30fps or 60fps), which creates perceptible UI stutter when interacting with comments, scrolling feeds, or viewing overlays.

| Option | Key | Type | Default | Supported Values | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Target Refresh Rate** | `targetRate` | String | `max` | `max`, `120`, `90`, `60` | Select target display refresh rate. `max` queries display hardware for highest supported rate. Any value exceeding physical screen capability is automatically clamped. |

#### Hardware Query & Boundary Clamping
In `TikTokRefreshRateHook.resolveTargetRate()`, queries `Display.getSupportedModes()` (Android M+) with fallback to `Display.getSupportedRefreshRates()` to detect physical display capabilities. If a configured rate exceeds physical panel frequency (e.g. selecting 120Hz on a 90Hz or 60Hz display), it automatically clamps to `maxSupportedRate` to prevent fatal WindowManager mode switch aborts.

---

### 4. Custom Offline Videos Limit

The **`Custom Offline Videos Limit`** patch customizes the maximum video caching limit available in TikTok's native Offline Mode bottom sheet. While stock TikTok restricts offline download caching to fixed tiers (e.g. 50, 100, 150), this patch injects a user-configurable count into the options list while preserving native Keva persistence and the Auto-adjust option.

| Option | Key | Type | Default | Supported Values | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Custom Offline Videos Limit** | `customLimit` | Integer | `1000` | Any integer `1` to `50000` | Maximum number of offline videos that can be cached for offline playback. |
### 5. Custom Share Sheet

The **`Custom Share Sheet`** patch cleans and customizes TikTok's native sharing bottom sheet via granular boolean toggles. It allows disabling third-party apps (WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, SMS, Twitter, Telegram, Reddit, etc.), suppressing the direct message friends row, protecting or toggling native sharing capabilities (Repost, QR code, Copy link, System share), and hiding individual utility actions (Promote, Why this video, Duet, Stitch, PiP, etc.).

### 10. Direct Message Declutter

The **`Direct Message Declutter`** patch cleans direct message conversations and chat list items via individual boolean toggles:

| Toggle Option | Key | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Hide Chat List Camera Icon** | `hideChatListCamera` | Boolean | `true` | Hides the quick camera action icon on conversation rows in the DM inbox chat list. |
| **Hide Header Call Button** | `hideCallButton` | Boolean | `true` | Hides the audio/video call button (receiver icon) in the 1-on-1 chat header bar. |

### 11. Popups & Prompts Suppressor

The **`Popups & Prompts Suppressor`** patch suppresses intrusive dialogs, bottom sheets, full-screen takeover prompts, and inline nudge banners across TikTok. Governed by 5 independent boolean toggle switches, it eliminates recurring account/contact sync nags, personalized sticker popups, annoying PopLayer promotion sheets, floating live stream teaser bubbles, and DM streak expiration warnings.

| Toggle Option | Key | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |

### 12. TikTok Privacy Permissions Stripper

The **`TikTok Privacy Permissions Stripper`** patch selectively strips sensitive privacy, sensor, hardware, and tracking permissions from `AndroidManifest.xml` via 15 granular boolean toggles. Five toggles default to `true` (`nfc`, `screenshotDetection`, `oemSignals`, `bluetooth`, `biometric`), while the remaining 10 toggles default to `false`.

> [!WARNING]
> Stripping permissions at the manifest level completely revokes the capability for the application at the OS package level. While notification, NFC, and OEM signal removals are safe, stripping hardware or media permissions will disable respective features (camera, microphone, gallery, background sync) or cause crashes if components lack graceful permission guards.

| Toggle Option | Key | Type | Default | Risk Level | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Strip Notification Permission** | `stripNotifications` | Boolean | `false` | **Safe** | Remove `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission (Android 13+). Notification channels cannot dispatch push alerts. |
| **Strip Camera Permission** | `stripCamera` | Boolean | `false` | **Risk** | Remove `CAMERA`. WARNING: Breaks camera recording, photo capturing, QR scanning, LIVE broadcasting, and video creation. |
| **Strip Microphone Permissions** | `stripMicrophone` | Boolean | `false` | **Risk** | Remove `RECORD_AUDIO`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE`, and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CAMERA`. WARNING: Breaks video voice recording, LIVE audio broadcasting, audio comments, and voice/video calling. |
| **Strip Storage & Media Permissions** | `stripStorageMedia` | Boolean | `false` | **Risk** | Remove external storage (`READ`/`WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`) and media permissions (`READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`, `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`, `READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED`, `ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION`). WARNING: Breaks local gallery picker, drafts, and video/photo saving. |
| **Strip Bluetooth Permissions** | `stripBluetooth` | Boolean | `true` | **Risk** | Remove `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`, and `BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE`. WARNING: Breaks Bluetooth audio accessories, wireless headphones low-latency sync, Cast devices, and external remote controls. |
| **Strip NFC Permission** | `stripNfc` | Boolean | `true` | **Safe\*** | Remove `NFC`. WARNING: Disables NFC tag interactions and NFC-based hardware authentication tokens. Safe unless using NFC hardware keys/login. |
| **Strip Biometric Permissions** | `stripBiometric` | Boolean | `true` | **Risk** | Remove `USE_BIOMETRIC` and `USE_FINGERPRINT`. WARNING: Breaks fingerprint/face biometric unlocking, passkeys, and biometric payment authorization. |
| **Strip Foreground Service Permissions** | `stripForegroundServices` | Boolean | `false` | **High Risk** | Remove generic `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` and specialized types (`DATA_SYNC`, `MEDIA_PLAYBACK`, `MEDIA_PROJECTION`, `PHONE_CALL`). WARNING: HIGH RISK. Breaks background video uploads, offline caching, media playback notification services, screen sharing, and background VoIP calls. |
| **Strip System Alert Window Permission** | `stripSystemAlertWindow` | Boolean | `false` | **Risk** | Remove `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`. WARNING: Breaks Picture-in-Picture overlay window outside the app, floating mini-player, and overlay notification heads. |
| **Strip Wake Lock Permission** | `stripWakeLock` | Boolean | `false` | **Risk** | Remove `WAKE_LOCK`. WARNING: Device CPU may sleep during media playback or long video uploads/downloads when screen turns off, suspending progress. |
| **Strip Screenshot Detection Permissions** | `stripScreenshotDetection` | Boolean | `true` | **Safe** | Remove `DETECT_SCREEN_CAPTURE` and `DETECT_SCREEN_RECORDING` to neutralize OS-level capture detection callbacks. Complements Universal Screenshot Protection Bypass. |
| **Strip Miscellaneous Hardware Permissions** | `stripMiscHardware` | Boolean | `false` | **Low/Med** | Remove `VIBRATE`, `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS`, `MANAGE_OWN_CALLS`, `REORDER_TASKS`, `SET_WALLPAPER`, and `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT`. WARNING: Disables haptic feedback vibration, volume adjustments, alarm priority intents, and live wallpaper export. |
| **Strip OEM Signals & Telemetry** | `stripOemSignals` | Boolean | `true` | **Safe\*** | Remove vendor diagnostic/attribution tokens (Huawei, Oppo, Orange, Samsung MapsAgent), launcher badge providers, AICore service binding, and internal TikTok IPC permissions. WARNING: Removing `DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION` may impact dynamic broadcast receivers registered at runtime. |
| **Strip Push Delivery Permissions** | `stripPushDelivery` | Boolean | `false` | **Risk** | Remove Google C2DM/FCM (`com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE`) and Amazon ADM (`com.amazon.device.messaging.permission.RECEIVE`). WARNING: Breaks background push notification reception. |
| **Strip In-App Billing Permission** | `stripBilling` | Boolean | `false` | **Risk** | Remove Google Play In-App Billing (`com.android.vending.BILLING`). WARNING: Breaks coin purchases and in-app monetization transactions. |

> [!NOTE]
> `stripScreenshotDetection` provides OS-layer defense-in-depth alongside Universal Screenshot Protection Bypass: while the runtime bypass clears `FLAG_SECURE` and stubs `registerScreenCaptureCallback`, it does not revoke manifest declarations. Stripping `DETECT_*` ensures the OS never dispatches capture callbacks regardless of runtime state. Both can coexist.

#### Non-Negotiables Excluded (Managed by Dedicated Patches)

Certain permissions are intentionally excluded from this manifest stripper because specialized patches handle them at runtime via bytecode hooks without breaking Android manifest contracts:

| Excluded Permissions | Authoritative Handler | Handling Mechanism & Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID`<br>`android.permission.ACCESS_ADSERVICES_AD_ID`<br>`android.permission.ACCESS_ADSERVICES_ATTRIBUTION`<br>`com.google.android.finsky.permission.BIND_GET_INSTALL_REFERRER_SERVICE` | **Universal Telemetry Neutralizer** + **Device Privacy Guard** | Bytecode hook zeroes GAID (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`), drops AdServices attribution tokens, and neutralizes Play Store install referrer receivers in runtime memory. |
| `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`<br>`android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` | **Device Privacy Guard** | Intercepts `LocationManager` and `PowerPermissions` headless dispatcher at the Dalvik layer, returning `PERMISSION_DENIED` and clearing location caches while avoiding manifest-level XML parse shifts. |
| `android.permission.READ_CONTACTS` | **Device Privacy Guard** | Intercepts `ContentResolver.query` and BPEA contacts reader trampolines (`LX/0OFU`, `LX/0OFw`), returning empty cursors and neutralizing background sync Lego tasks without breaking caller state. |
| `android.permission.INTERNET` | **Universal Offline Mode** *(Optional)* | **Total Exclusion**: Revoking `INTERNET` at the manifest level causes Linux kernel socket allocation denials (`EPERM` / `socket failed: EACCES`), crashing the process at frame 0. Users requiring total offline isolation should use [Universal Offline Mode](../universal-patches.md#5-universal-offline-mode-universalofflinepatch). |

## 🔒 Deep Technical Patch Breakdown

### 1. Media Usability & Watermark-Free Downloader (`mediaEnhancementsPatch`)
- **Forced Download Button Unblock**:
  - Hooks `Aweme.isPreventDownload()Z` -> returns `false`.
  - Hooks `Aweme.getIsCommentPostVideo()Z` -> returns `false`.
  - Flips internal `canDownload` boolean fields via reflection in `TikTokMediaHook`.
  - Hooks download action `LX/0HJb;->enable()Z` -> returns `true`, guaranteeing the Save action in the Share panel is clickable and never grayed out.
- **Clean Watermark-Free Downloads**:
  - Hooks `Aweme.getDownloadWithoutWatermark()Z` -> returns `true`.
  - Hooks `Aweme.needTTSWatermarkWhenDownload()Z` -> returns `false`.
  - Extracts clean, original `playAddr` media stream URLs, bypassing server-side watermark render queues.
- **Client-Side Watermark Neutralization**:
  - Stubs `WaterMarkServiceImpl.waterMark()` with `return-void` to prevent client-rendered overlay compositing.

### 2. Comment Customizer (`commentCustomizerPatch`)
- Consolidates comment section usability enhancements and decluttering options via compile/patch-time toggles:
  - **`commentSortControls` (default: true)**: Unlocks TikTok's internal native comment sorting controls sheet (Most Relevant, Newest, Creator Only, Media Only) by overriding `comment_sort_opt_style` configuration getter (`2`) and Aweme comment sort eligibility checks.
  - **`copyWithoutUsername` (default: true)**: Copies clean comment text without prepending the author username (`@username: `). Hooks `ClipData` builder `LIZ(String, String, List)` and BPEA clipboard helper callers.
  - **`disableSuggestedEmojis` (default: true)**: Removes the horizontal bar of suggested quick emojis above the comment input box across active keyboard and passive comment views (`ExposedEmojiPanelTrigger`, `CommentPanelFakeInput`, `CommentKeyboardModel`, `PersonalizedEmojiExperiment`).
  - **`hideCommentQuickActions` (default: true)**: Hides the quick action buttons (photo/gallery, emoji/sticker, and mention `@`) inside the comment input bar (`BaseInputAssem`, `CommentKeyboardModel`, and `TikTokCommentHook.hideCommentQuickActions`).
  - **`hideCommentSurveys` (default: true)**: Hides surveys, opinion questionnaires, and feedback cards embedded within comment lists. Neutralizes survey data item providers (`CommentSurveyDataItem`), display eligibility checks (`shouldShow`), pre-layout Lynx gates, and stubs `CommentLynxCell` view creation and binding with a GONE view.
  - **`hideStoryRings` (default: true)**: Removes profile photo story rings from avatars in the comment section. Stubs `AvatarRing.setMode` with `return-void`, rewrites `AvatarRing.draw` to pass through to `FrameLayout.draw` without rendering ring arcs, and neutralizes `AvatarRing.onInterceptTouchEvent` -> `false`.
  - **`enableVoiceComments` (default: true)**: Forces native voice comment recording buttons in comment input bars, bypassing regional rollout restrictions and remote server blocks (`audio_comment_publish`, `comment_audio_publish_entry_forbidden`, `VEAudioRecorder`).
  - **`autoTranslate` (default: false)**: Automatically dispatches batch translations for incoming comments via TikTok's native engine (`BaseCommentCell`, `CommentList.onLoaded`).
  - **`commentSendFix` (default: true)**: Fixes silently dropped comments by substituting the null top-page screen with the owning panel screen (`CommentPublishViewModel.kJ1`, event `click_comment_send`).
  - **`hideCommentPopupAds` (default: true)**: Blocks brand surprise animations over comments via `CommentSurpriseStruct` with path tags (`page/publish/milestone`, self-celebrations are preserved).

### 3. Device Privacy Guard (`devicePrivacyGuardPatch`)
> [!NOTE]
> **Bytecode-Only Privacy Architecture (`ResourceMode.RAW`)**:
> Unlike apps with standard resource structures, TikTok's entire patch suite strictly avoids resource decoding (`resourcePatch`). Re-encoding TikTok's obfuscated resource tree via `arsclib` drops launcher icon drawables (`res/a/aq2.xml`, `res/a/aq3.xml`). Privacy is enforced at the Dalvik bytecode execution layer via runtime permission interception, in-app nag suppression, sensor silencing, and telemetry neutralization while keeping APK resources intact.

- **Runtime Permission Interception & Denial Handling**:
  - Intercepts ByteDance Helios static dispatcher (`LX/02z2;->LLJ`) for `Activity.requestPermissions`.
  - Intercepts PowerPermissions headless engine (`FakeFragment;->cY` / `jT`) to immediately dispatch denials (`PackageManager.PERMISSION_DENIED`) for invasive permissions (`READ_CONTACTS`, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_LOCAL_NETWORK`, `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`, `BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`, `ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION`, `AD_ID`, `ACCESS_ADSERVICES_AD_ID`, `ACCESS_ADSERVICES_ATTRIBUTION`).
  - Resets permanent denial flags in Keva stores (`FriendsSharePreferences -> read_contact_denied = false`, `permission_store -> <perm> = false`) to prevent persistent denial profiling.
  - Hooks permission cache check (`LX/04CN;->LIZ`) returning `false` for blocked permissions to suppress permanently-denied flags.
- **In-App Permission Dialog, Settings Redirect & Location Popup Suppression**:
  - Neutralizes permanently denied system settings redirect dialogs (`LX/06WV;->LJI(Activity, String, boolean)Z` -> returns `false` for blocked permissions), eliminating persistent in-app prompts nudging users to open device Application Details Settings.
  - Suppresses relation onboarding and permission dialog triggers (`LX/16rQ.LIZJ` -> `false` for contacts, `LX/16rP.LIZJ` -> `false` for Facebook, and `LX/16rO.LIZIZ` -> `false` for permission popups).
  - Suppresses relation/contacts synchronization auth dialogs (`RelationAuthDialogControl.LJIIIIZZ` -> `false`, `RelationAuthDialogControl.LJI` -> `false`).
  - Suppresses location popups and scenes (`LX/0BK7` popup checks and `LocationServiceImpl.LJIIZILJ`, `LJIJ`).
- **Background Sync Lego Task Neutralization**:
  - Stubs background contacts sync tasks (`ContactsUploadRequest.run`, `PermissionRequestAndUploadLegoTask.run`, `IMContactInitTask.run`, `MafFollowBackBootRequest.run`).
  - Stubs background location init tasks (`InitLocationTask.run`, `InitLocationTaskHolder$Background.run`, `InitLocationTaskHolder$Main.run`).
- **Google Advertising ID (GAID) Zeroing**:
  - Hooks GAID providers (`LX/02z2;->LLLLIIL` -> `null`, `LLLLIIIILLL` -> `"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"`).
- **Universal Package Query Isolation**: Intercepts `PackageManager` query trampolines (`LX/00m8.U3`, `LX/00m8.R3`) and throws a controlled `NameNotFoundException` when external installed apps are queried, isolating app visibility without requiring resource decoding.
- **Contacts Isolation**: Neutralizes BPEA contacts reader `LX/0OFU.LIZ()` to return empty list and `LX/0OFw.LIZ()` to return a null cursor safely.
- **HAR Motion Sensor Silencing**: Injects `return -1` into `HarSensorManager` init and stubs `onSensorChanged` to stop physical movement fingerprinting.
- **Clipboard Protection**: Blocks programmatic and BPEA background clipboard reading methods (`LX/01ZZ.LIZ`, `LX/0jUy.LIZIZ`).
- **Framework Call-Site Filtering (insert-only)**:
  - `ContentResolver.query` (3 overloads) filtered by URI via `noteUri`/`filterNotedResult` (contacts -> empty cursor).
  - `queryIntentActivities` filtered via `noteIntent`/`filterNotedIntentResult` (explicit intents pass through, broad queries -> empty list).
  - `getLastKnownLocation` -> `null`.
  - `requestSingleUpdate` canceled via `removeUpdates`.
  - `isProviderEnabled` / `isLocationEnabled` -> `false`.

### 4. Bypass Screen Capture Detection (`bypassScreenCapturePatch`)
- Clears `FLAG_SECURE` (`0x2000`) on window layouts via `AntiScreenRecordController.applyFlag(enabled=false)`, `makeScreenProtection(enable=false)`, and neutralizes global Activity `FLAG_SECURE` enforcement (`setFlags(8192, 8192)`), enabling screenshots and screen recordings across restricted views, live courses, and ephemeral chats.
- Neutralizes dynamic Circle to Search and recent apps blocking: stubs `MainContentSecurityAssem` (`dispatchTouchEvent`, `rq`), neutralizes `ContentSecurityHelper` bottom navigation touch listeners (`LIZ(MotionEvent) -> return-void`, `LIZJ() -> false`), and neutralizes the `circle_search_block` experiment to prevent bottom touch interception from injecting `FLAG_SECURE` at navigation gestures (restoring Circle to Search, screen translate, music search, and recent apps preview snapshots).
- Neutralizes screenshot detection listeners, floating feedback prompts, and telemetry (`ScreenShotFeedbackService` and startup Lego tasks).

### 5. Feed Bloat & Distraction Blocker (`feedBloatBlockerPatch`)
- **Rewards Pendants Suppression**: Injects `return-void` into `SpecActWidget.bind(ViewGroup)` to prevent floating Rewards widgets (countdown coins, soccer ball stickers) from attaching to feed views.
- **Sticker & Card Stripping**: Nullifies `Aweme.getActivityPendant()`, `getCommerceStickerInfo()`, `getFloatingCardInfo()`, and `getBannerTip()`.
- **Feed Stream Purge**: Filters suggested accounts, mini-games, CapCut creation prompts, memories recaps, mini-dramas, in-feed search interest cards (card type `38`), and trending search recommendation cards (card types `34`, `35`) before UI adapter binding via `TikTokFeedAdFilter.isFeedBloat()`.
- **Community & Lynx Cards Suppression**: Neutralizes all inserted non-video Lynx cards and topic cards via `TikTokFeedAdFilter.isFeedBloat()` (`CardInsertInfo != null`, `recommendCardType > 0`), stubs `Aweme.getExploreCommunityCommentShowType()` -> `null`, and sanitizes community comment headers via `stripSurveyBloat()`.
- **Post-Video Safety Surveys & Questionnaires Neutralization**: Suppresses in-feed safety evaluation surveys ("¿Valió la pena ver este video?", feedback questionnaires, push surveys, and bottom survey buttons). Injects `return-void` into `CellSurveyComponent` (`onViewCreated`, `ur`, `wr`) and `FeedBottomSurveyButtonComponent.onParentViewCreated()`, forces `AwemeExtKt.isWithSurvey()` -> `false`, `PNSSurveyService.LIZIZ()` -> `false`, `PushSurveyAssemTrigger.yr()` -> `false`, nullifies `Aweme` survey getters (`getWithSurvey() -> false`, `getSurveyInfo() -> null`, `getSurveyInfos() -> null`, `getPersonalizedSurveyUI() -> null`, `getOnboardingSurvey() -> null`, `getPersonalizedOnboardingSurvey() -> null`), prunes standalone survey cards without media content (`hasMediaContent == false`), and strips residual survey bloat metadata on retained videos and photo mode posts (`TikTokFeedAdFilter.stripSurveyBloat()`).
- **Search Recommendation Request Neutralization**: Stubs `AbsSearchService.u()Ljava/util/List;` to return an empty list (`Collections.emptyList()`), preventing the search module from registering card insert request generators into the feed pipeline.
- **Friends Feed Rec User Cards & Bloat Neutralization**: Injects `p1 = false, p2 = false` into `FriendsV3RecUserConfig.<init>(ZZ)V` to prevent `FriendsV3FeedListViewModel` from instantiating suggested friend cards (`FriendsV3RecUserItem`) or bottom recommendation lists (`FriendsV3BottomRecListItem`). Intercepts `FriendsV3FeedResponse.<init>` to filter in-feed bloat and nullify suggested friends (`newlyShownMafIds = null`), and hooks `FriendsFeedResponse.<init>` (V2) to prune inserted card results (`cardInsertResults = null`, `insertedResults = null`). Because network responses are deserialized through the no-arg constructors, the same filtering and nulling also runs at the network boundary via `FriendsV3FeedNetworkSource.LJ` (V3) and the return points of the obfuscated friend feed request `LX/06CX;->LIZLLL` (V2); the constructor hooks remain for cached and copied responses. Injects immediate `View.GONE` and dimensions contraction (`0x0`) into `FriendsV3HorizontalRecUserCardCell.onItemViewCreated` and `FriendsV3BottomRecUserListCell.onItemViewCreated` as a fallback UI defense.

### 6. Navigation & Header Declutter (`feedNavigationDeclutterPatch`)
- Consolidates clutter removal across the feed navigation strip, top toolbar, and video bottom bars via compile/patch-time toggles:
  - **`hideNearbyTab` (default: true)**: Removes the Nearby (local city or region) feed tab from the top navigation strip. Hooks `NearbyServiceImpl.LJIIZILJ()` tab provider `LJ()` -> `null`, `NearbyTabProtocol.enable()` -> `false`, and service boolean gates.
  - **`hideCommunityTab` (default: true)**: Removes the Community (Explore) feed tab from the top navigation strip and bottom navigation bar. Hooks `ExploreFeedServiceImpl.LIZ()` -> `false`, tab provider `LJ()` / `LIZ()` -> `null`, and `ExploreBottomTabProtocol.enable()` -> `false`.
  - **`hideTopLiveEntrance` (default: false)**: Removes the top-left LIVE broadcast button and tab entry point from the top navigation bar. Hooks `LiveIconGenerator.enabled()` -> `false`, view method -> `null`, and `LiveTabProtocol.enable()` -> `false`.
  - **`hideFeedSearchBar` (default: true)**: Removes the in-video bottom search suggestion and trending query bar. Hooks `FeedSearchBottomBarAssem` and `FeedSearchItemViewModel` trigger/binding methods to suppress bottom query pills.
  - **`hidePublishTab` (default: false)**: Removes the central `+` create / publish content button from the bottom navigation bar. Hooks `PublishTabProtocol.enable()` -> `false` and forces `View.GONE` (`0x8`) in `PublishBottomTabViewFactory.LIZ`, seamlessly redistributing the remaining 4 navigation tabs (Home, Friends, Inbox, Profile).
  - **`hideFriendsAvatarPreview` (default: true)**: Prevents friend profile pictures from replacing the Friends icon on the bottom navigation bar. Suppresses avatar fetching and ability attachment via `ISocial2TabRedDotService` (`enableTabAvatar` -> `false`, `loadAvatarAbility` -> `return-void`, `dealWithFriendsAvatar` -> `return-void`), neutralizes `BaseBottomTabAvatarAbility` and `FriendBottomTabAvatarAbility` (`isShowing` -> `false`, `cr2` -> `false`), stubs bottom tab manager view attachment and binding (`LJI`, `LJII`, `LJJJI` -> `return-void`, `LJJIIZ` -> `false`), and neutralizes the new-user exemption/reminder setting (`tt_friends_tab_avatar_exemption_new_user_days` -> `false`), ensuring the standard Friends icon remains consistently visible.
  - **`hideInboxBadge` (default: true)**: Removes the unread message counter badge and notification red dot from the bottom Messages (Inbox) tab. Stubs `NoticeCountTabBadgePresentServiceImpl` (`onResume`, `onReset` -> `return-void`, `isShowing` -> `false`), neutralizes evaluation and EventBus dispatchers on the presentation manager (`LJJIJIIJI` -> `return-void`, `onNoticeCountChangedEvent` -> `return-void`), and injects guards into the bottom Tab Manager (`LJIIL` -> forces count to 0, `LJJL` -> returns early, `LJIJJLI` -> returns 0) for the `NOTIFICATION` tab.

### 7. Feed Interface Declutter (`feedInterfaceDeclutterPatch`)
- Consolidates clutter removal across feed video cell overlay elements via compile/patch-time toggles:
  - **`hideRepostBadge` (default: true)**: Hides the repost and shared-by pill badge ('Shared by' / 'Reposted') above creator details on feed videos. Hooks `UpvoteVideoTrigger.yr(VideoItemParams)Z` -> returns `false`, preventing `UpvoteVideoAssemNew` from being attached or activated. Stubs `UpvoteVideoAssemNew` methods (`tr`/`hb` -> `false`, `LLLLIILL`/`LLILZ`/`z4` -> `return-void`, `onViewCreated` -> `View.GONE`).
  - **`hideVideoDescriptions` (default: true)**: Hides video descriptions, captions, hashtags, "more" expansion buttons, and the "See translation" interactive button across feed videos while keeping creator and author info intact.

- Filters and skips videos tagged with native AI-generated metadata, C2PA content credentials, or creator AI disclosure tags across the For You, Following, and Friends feeds.
- **Feed API Response Interception**: Hooks `FeedApiService.fetchFeedList` to filter incoming items at the network response boundary before model mapping.
- **Feed Item Model Interception**: Hooks `FeedItemList.getItems()` and `FollowFeedList.getItems()` to sanitize feed collections in-situ.
- **Friends Feed Network Interception**: Hooks `FriendsV3FeedNetworkSource.LJ` (V3 response handler) and the obfuscated friend feed request `LX/06CX;->LIZLLL` (`/tiktok/v1/friend/friend_feed`, V2) return points to filter `friendsV3Feeds` / `friendFeedData` after deserialization.
- **Multi-Vector AI Metadata Inspection**: Inspects `Aweme` for:
  - `AIGCInfo` (`AIGCLabelType != 0`, `createByAI == true`).
  - `ModerationAigcInfo` (`moderationAigcLabelType != 0`, `moderationUserLabelStatus != 0`, `creatorGuidanceStatus != 0`, `moderationCreatorSegment` populated).
  - `C2PAInfo` (`aigcSrc`, `firstAigcSrc`, `lastAigcSrc` populated).
  - Specific AI sub-structures (`aiAliveInfo`, `aiPortraitInfo`, `aiRemixInfo`, `aiTheaterInfo`, `aiChatEditorInfo`).
  - Native AI banners and anchors (`ANCHOR_AIGC`, Lynx AI disclosure templates).

- **Mutual Follow & Suggested Tag Inspection**:
  - Validates `author.getFollowStatus() == 2` (mutual friends who follow each other). If the author is not a mutual friend (`followStatus != 2`), the video is pruned from playback.
  - Detects and prunes suggested accounts via `User.getMatchedFriendStruct()`, `User.isMatchedFriendAvailable()`, and `User.getRecType()`.
  - Prunes videos tagged with recommendation relation labels (`Aweme.getFeedRelationLabel()`, `getRelationLabel()`, `getRelationRecommendInfo()`, and `getRecReasonsStruct()`).
  - For reposts (`FriendsV3RepostModel`), inspects the `reposter` user profile: ensures `reposter.getFollowStatus() == 2` and filters out suggested reposter accounts.
  - Automatically preserves user's own uploads and self-reposts by verifying `author.getUid()` / `reposter.getUid()` against the logged-in user (`IUserService.getCurrentUserID()`).

### 15. Disable Search Video Autoplay (`disableSearchVideoAutoplayPatch`)
- Disables automatic video and media playback in TikTok search results, preserving bandwidth and preventing unwanted audio or distraction while browsing search cards.
- **Search List Autoplay Calculation Loop Suppression**: Injects `return-void` at index 0 of `SearchListAutoplayHelper.LIZIZ(Z LX/0JHH;)V` (fingerprinted by string `"checkLogic() is not called on main thread"`), halting the recurring scroll and idle candidate evaluation cycle.
- **Card AutoPlay Ability Inactivation**: Injects `const/4 v0, 0` / `return v0` into `SearchCardVideoPlayerAssem$autoPlayAbility$2$1.l2()Z`, `SearchVideoForLynx$ability$1.l2()Z`, and `SearchCardPhotoPlayerAssem$autoPlayAbility$2$1.l2()Z`, asserting `false` for card autoplay eligibility.
- **Playback Execution Guard**: Injects `return-void` into `r()V` on all search card `AutoPlayAbility` implementations, preventing any direct invocation from triggering video playback or hiding cover thumbnails. Detail view playback when opening a video remains fully functional via `PlayerController`.

### 16. Resume Video After Scroll (`resumeVideoAfterScrollPatch`)
- Persists and restores playback timestamp when scrolling away and returning to feed videos.
- **Configuration Gate Activation**: Hooks `FeedPlayProgressContinueConfig` gate (`invoke()`), forcing `enable = true`.

- **Playback Tracking**: Hooks `PlayerController.onPlayProgressChange(String, long, long)` (recording videos viewed for >= 5s or >= 70% duration) and `PlayerController.onPlayCompleted(String)`.
- **Network Ingestion Filtering**: Hooks `FeedApiService.fetchFeedList()` return points, pruning seen video entries directly from deserialized `FeedItemList` payloads before they are delivered to the UI layer, preventing adapter desynchronization and frame drops.

### 19. Disable Post-Download Share Dialog (`disablePostDownloadDialogPatch`)
- Suppresses the automatic 'Share to' and friend suggestions bottom sheet that pops up after finishing a video or media download.
- **Bottom Sheet Presentation Neutralization**: Stubs the popup display launcher in `DownloadAndShareFragment` (fingerprinted by `definingClass = DownloadAndShareFragment` and string `"after_video_saved_share_to_nscreen"`) with `return-void` at instruction offset 0, preventing the creation and display of the `TuxSheet` bottom sheet dialog while preserving download completion toasts and saved file integrity.

### 20. Hide Inbox Story & Status Tray (`hideInboxStoryTrayPatch`)
- Removes the horizontal story carousel, status notes, and creation bubbles (Skylight) displayed at the top of the direct messages inbox.

  - `disableLikeRepost` (default: `true`): Prevents long-pressing the Like (heart) button from opening TikTok's Repost action panel. Hooks `VideoDiggAssem.Sr(View)Z` to consume the long-press gesture (`return true`) without triggering the repost panel or falling through to click. Single tap to like or unlike remains fully functional.
  - `disableShareQuickDms` (default: `true`): Prevents holding the Share button from launching the quick-share recent contacts tray. Overrides the `im_long_press_share_button_to_quick_share` configuration lambda to return `0` (`Integer.valueOf(0)`) and neutralizes the `ShareUnreadVideoQuickDMTrigger` eligibility check -> returns `false`. Single tap to open the full share sheet remains fully functional.
  - `disableCommentReactions` (default: `true`): Prevents long-pressing the Comment button from opening the quick emoji reaction picker. Overrides the `long_press_quick_comment` configuration lambda to return `0` (`Integer.valueOf(0)`), causing `VideoCommentAssem.Kr()` and `Lr()` to attach only the native single-tap `OnClickListener` without long-press touch listeners. Single tap to open comments remains fully functional.

### 22. Enable Profile Banner (`profileBannerPatch`)
- Unlocks the custom profile banner (background header cover) feature on user profiles and enables the banner selection, cropping, and editing tools in Edit Profile.
- **ProfileBackgroundExp Gate Activation**: Hooks the main feature evaluation gate in `ProfileBackgroundExp` (`(Z)Z`) -> returns `true`, allowing `MusProfileEditFragment` to attach `ProfileBgEditHelper` (`LX/0axG`) and `ProfileRootBaseComponent` to assemble the `ProfileBackgroundComponent`.

### 23. Direct Message Declutter (`directMessageDeclutterPatch`)
- Declutters direct message chat rooms and the inbox conversation list via modular boolean toggles:
  - **Chat List Camera Icon (`hideChatListCamera`)**: Hooks the serialized view configuration model `LX/0CbL;` in its `<init>` constructors and `setShowCameraIcon(Z)V` to enforce `showCameraIcon = false`, removing the camera shortcut on conversation list rows.
  - **Header Call Button (`hideCallButton`)**: In `BaseSingleChatTitleBarRightAssem.onViewCreated(View)V`, sets the call icon view (`0x7f0a39ae` / `icon_call_container`) to `View.GONE` and sets field `LLLFF` to `null` to neutralize async observer callbacks without crashing.
  - **Message Forward Button (`hideMessageForwardButton`)**: In `SideMessageStatusReusedSkeletonUISlot;->vs(LX/0BVS;)LX/0pxs;`, substitutes return value `LX/0pxs;->FORWARD` with `LX/0pxs;->NOTHING`, suppressing the forward arrow button beside individual chat messages while keeping the reply button functional.
  - **Reaction & Streak Mascot Bar (`hideReactionTray`)**: Hooks `ActionBarServiceImpl;->LJI()Z` to return `false` (neutralizing feature eligibility) and injects `View.GONE` into `ActionBarUIAssem.onViewCreated(View)V` immediately prior to `return-void`, hiding the emoji reaction bar and streak mascot.
  - **Input Camera Shortcut (`hideInputCamera`)**: Hooks `DMCameraFeatureImpl;->LJII(...)` to return `null` and suppresses container `0x7f0a479c` (`input_camera_container`) with `View.GONE` in `IMInputAssem.onViewCreated(View)V`.
  - **Right Input Action Buttons (`hideGalleryButton`, `hideEmojiButton`, `hideVoiceRecordButton`)**:
    - **Photo Album / Gallery**: Sets `0x7f0a3d4f` (`im_photo_btn`) to `View.GONE` and returns early in `IMImageBtnViewAssem.Wr(View)V`.
    - **Stickers & Emojis**: Sets `0x7f0a3ce0` (`im_emoji_btn`) to `View.GONE` and returns early in `InputEmojiButtonUIAssem.onViewCreated(View)V`. For the redesigned input bar layout (`ui_slot_input_layout_redesign`), forces the `InputIconBtn` `EMOJI_BTN` slot view (`0x7f0a3aba` / `kwq`) to 0x0 dimensions (`width = 0`, `height = 0`), strips margins (`setMarginEnd(0)`), disables click and touch interactions (`setClickable(false)`, `setEnabled(false)`), scaled to 0 (`setScaleX(0f)`, `setScaleY(0f)`), and sets `View.GONE` directly in its setup lambda built by `LX/0YEc;->LIZ`.
    - **Voice Record**: Sets `0x7f0a4980` (`record_btn`) to `View.GONE` and returns early in `RecordBtnAssem.onViewCreated(View)V`.
    - *Preservation Invariant*: The parent actions container `0x7f0a3dd3` (`im_input_right_container`) is intentionally left intact so that `SendButtonAssemV2` appears seamlessly when typing text.
  - **Try Effect CTA Button (`hideTryEffectButton`)**: Hooks both static eligibility gate methods in obfuscated gate class `LX/0qRQ;` (`LIZIZ(...)Z` called by `AwemeCardAssem` and `LIZJ(...)Z` called by CTA list builders `LX/0qPi`/`LX/0qPj` before instantiating `TryEffectCTAButtonType` / `LX/0YK6;`) to return `false`, neutralizing the 'Try effect' camera shortcut button on shared videos in direct messages.
  - **Sticker Reply Suggestions (`hideStickerReplySuggestions`)**: Neutralizes sticker suggestion popups and reply banners in direct messages:
    - **Incoming Reply Suggestions**: In `ReplyToStickerRecommendationViewModel`, hooks the static synthetic default-args dispatcher method (`y83(...)V`) by injecting a bitmask check on register `p3` at instruction offset 0 (`and-int/lit8 v0, p3, 0x2`). When called by automatic triggers without a message argument (mask contains bit `0x2`), it returns early (`return-void`), suppressing the automatic 'Tap a sticker to reply' suggestion panel above the text input bar while preserving manual sticker replies initiated via the sticker reply button (mask `0x1`).
    - **Preshown Reply Banner**: Hooks `PreshownStickerBannerProtocol.isEnabled()Z` -> `false` and converts `PreshownStickerBannerProtocol.intercept(List)List` to passthrough `return-object p1`, preventing the bottom conversation banner from instantiating.
    - **Typing Recommendations**: Hooks `TypingRecommendationPanelAssem.Kq()Z` -> `false` and stubs the typing strip pipeline `Aq(LX/0XIS;)V`, `Rq(LX/0pPl;)V`, `Sq(List;)V`, `rq(LX/0pPl;)V` and `uq(LX/0pPl;)V` with `return-void`, suppressing the typing-triggered sticker/GIF strip above the input bar.

### 24. Popups & Prompts Suppressor (`popupsAndPromptsSuppressorPatch`)

    - Stubs `LX/0YL4;->LJII(...)V` with `return-void` to suppress "Get notifications from other accounts" prompts when switching accounts.
    - Suppresses the "Find contacts" sync overlay on the Friends tab by stubbing `LX/0v6A;->canShow()Z` -> `false`, `LX/0v6A;->LJII(...)V` -> `return-void`, and `RelationAuthDialogControl;->LJFF(...)V` -> `return-void`. Note: The secondary Find Contacts sync overlay remains pending runtime flow analysis.
    - Suppresses 2-Step Verification security checkup popups and message push guides by intercepting `LocalCampaignManager.showLocalCampaign` -> `false` and `PopSuiteManagerService.shouldShowPopSuitePopup` -> `false` (generalized to block `UPSELL_2SV_POPUP`, `MESSAGE_REQUEST_PUSH_GUIDE_POPUP`, and `GPPPA` 2SV fullsheet/profile variants).
  - **Sticker Recommendations (`suppressStickerRecommendations`)**:
    - Disables sticker typing recommendations in direct messages by intercepting `ChatFeatureListConf.featureEnable` -> `false` when queried for `TYPING_RECOMMEND`.
  - **PopLayer Prompts & Nags (`filterPopLayerPrompts`)**:
    - Hooks `LX/07Q5;->canShow()Z` (`PopLayerBaseFragment.canShow`) to check against companion extension hook `TikTokPopupHook.shouldSuppressPopLayer()`.

    - Stubs `LX/0P2r;->LIZ()V` with `return-void` to strictly block the "Profile view history turn-on" PopLayer sheet before it reaches the trigger evaluation.
  - **Live Stream Teaser Bubble (`suppressLiveTeaserBubble`)**:
    - Suppresses floating live stream preview teaser bubbles over feed videos by stubbing `LiveBubbleUtil.LIZ` -> `return-void` and forcing `LiveBubbleUtil.LJIIIIZZ` -> `false`.
  - **DM Streak Reminders (`suppressStreakReminders`)**:
    - Neutralizes streak expiration urgency alerts and inline reminder messages in direct messages by forcing `LX/0O2v;->LIZ` (`has_streak_reminder_inline_msg`) -> `false`.

### 26. Disable HDR Video Playback (`disableHdrVideoPatch`)
- Forces the video playback engine to select standard SDR bitrates (BT.709/sRGB) instead of HDR (HDR10/PQ/HLG), preventing blinding screen brightness spikes and display thermal throttling while preserving smooth playback.
- Stubs `isForceHdrOff()Z` -> `true` across all `ISimPlayerConfig` and `PlayerConfigImpl` implementations to trigger PlayerKit's native HDR rendition filter.
- Stubs `SimVideoUrlModel.isHaveHdr()Z` -> `false` and `SimBitRate.isHdr()Z` -> `false` to ensure player models report streams strictly as standard dynamic range.

### 27. TikTok Privacy Permissions Stripper (`tikTokPrivacyPermissionsStripperPatch`)
- **Manifest DOM Transformation**:
  - Implemented as a clean `resourcePatch` executing directly against `AndroidManifest.xml`.
  - Uses `Element.stripPermissionsWhere` to query and remove direct children matching `uses-permission` and `uses-permission-sdk-23` without altering unrelated manifest metadata or application attributes.
  - Guarantees zero resource re-encoding regressions (unlike full ARSC recompilation).
- **Comprehensive Manifest Coverage & Pruning Discipline**:
  - Covers all 64 unique permissions extracted from TikTok 47.1.4 standalone manifest (`tiktok_47.1.4_orig.apk`).
  - 51 permissions mapped into 15 categorized boolean toggle switches (5 default `true`: `nfc`, `screenshotDetection`, `oemSignals`, `bluetooth`, `biometric`; 10 default `false`).
  - 7 non-negotiable permissions pruned from manifest stripping and delegated to specialized runtime governors (**Universal Telemetry Neutralizer** and **Device Privacy Guard**).
  - 1 kernel-critical permission (`android.permission.INTERNET`) explicitly excluded to prevent cold startup socket allocation aborts.
- **Dynamic Mutation & Telemetry Summary**:
  - Validates manifest existence before execution.
  - Aggregates enabled toggles into a single pass predicate to prune elements efficiently.

- **Multi-Vector Commercial & Branded Metadata Inspection**: Inspects `Aweme` for:
  - `AwemeCommerceStruct` (`bcHashtag` tag disclosure text, `isBrandedContent` / `brandedContentType > 0`, `isBrandOrganicContent` / `brandOrganicType > 0`, `CommerceLabelInfo.bcLabelDisplayType == 1`, `ecSearchBoBcLabelText`).
  - `brandContentAccounts` (tagged sponsor accounts list).
  - `starAtlasOrderId` (ByteDance Star Atlas commercial order ID).
  - `commercialVideoInfo` (commercial video payload marker).
  - `promoteModel` and `promoteIconText` (native in-feed promotion triggers).
  - Multi-locale description, caption, banner, and anchor fallback pattern matching (`#paidpartnership`, `#brandedcontent`, `#contenidopromocional`, `[Contenido Promocional]`, `[Paid partnership]`, `[Contenu sponsorisé]`, `[Colaboración pagada]`, `[Parceria paga]`, etc.).
