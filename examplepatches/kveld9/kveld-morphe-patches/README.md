## ⚠️ Compatibility & Operational Notes

### ⌨️ Gboard Lite: Target Variant & Offline Dictionary Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Always download the standalone `lite` / `lite_beta` 64-bit APK (nodpi) from [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/gboard/):**
>
> - **Current Target**: `18.1.3.962075747-lite_beta-arm64-v8a`
> - **Format**: `APK` _(Do **NOT** download `BUNDLE` / split packages)_
> - **Architecture**: `arm64-v8a`
> - **Screen DPI**: `nodpi`

#### 🔧 Predictive Text & Glide Typing on Fresh Installations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Gboard Lite does not bundle language dictionaries, predictive text models, or gesture/glide typing decoding models inside the APK.**
> Unlike the full Gboard APK, Gboard Lite downloads language models on-demand upon first launch via Google's **MDD (Mobile Data Download)** and **Superpacks** subsystems.

If you perform a clean install of Gboard Lite with background sync debloat patches enabled, Gboard will be prevented from downloading the initial dictionary and gesture model pack for your language. This results in an empty suggestion bar, no predictive text, and **Glide Typing (swipe to type) not working**.

##### How to set up Gboard Lite with working predictive text & glide typing:

1. **When patching for a clean install (or when adding new languages):**
    - **Temporarily uncheck:**
        - ❌ `Disable MDD Background Sync`
        - ❌ `Disable Superpacks Eager Sync`
        - ❌ `Disable WorkManager`
    - _(Also ensure `Force Incognito Mode` is unchecked if you want personalized learning and history)._
2. **Open Gboard once with an active Internet connection:**
    - Type a few words, test a swipe gesture, or navigate to _Gboard Settings > Languages_ so it downloads your language dictionary and gesture pack into local storage (`/data/data/...`).
3. **Re-apply debloat patches (Optional):**
    - Once your language packs are cached locally on device, you can re-patch with `Disable MDD Background Sync`, `Disable Superpacks Eager Sync`, and `Disable WorkManager` to freeze background network traffic and disk polling.

### 🦁 Brave Browser: Required Variant & Native Offsets

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Always use `Bravemonoarm64.apk` from [Brave GitHub Releases](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/releases).**
> Do **NOT** use `Bravearm64Universal.apk`, `Bravearm64.apk`, or 32-bit / x86 builds (`Bravearm.apk`, `Bravemonox64.apk`, etc.).
>
> - **Current Target**: `1.94.121` (`Bravemonoarm64.apk`)
> - **Architecture**: `arm64-v8a` (Monochrome)
> - **Package Name**: `com.brave.browser`
>
> <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/releases/download/v1.94.121/Bravemonoarm64.apk"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Bravemonoarm64.apk_(v1.94.121)-FF4500?style=for-the-badge&logo=brave&logoColor=white" alt="Download Brave APK" /></a>

#### ❓ Why `Bravemonoarm64.apk`?

- **Bytecode Consistency**: `Bravemonoarm64.apk` is the official 64-bit ARM Monochrome build. Other variants (especially _Universal_) use different R8/ProGuard obfuscation passes and aggressive method inlining, which causes Dalvik fingerprint mismatches (e.g. in Variations seed fetching and Brave Origin helpers).
- **Native ARM64 Hooks**: Byte-level offsets in `lib/arm64-v8a/libchrome.so` (such as domain redirection and native scheduler gates) are calculated strictly against ARM64 Monochrome binaries.

---

### 🔴 Vivaldi Browser Snapshot: Target APK & Architecture

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Always download the official `arm64-v8a` APK directly from the [Vivaldi Android Blog](https://vivaldi.com/blog/android/).**
> In every release announcement blog post, Vivaldi provides direct official APK download links at the bottom.
>
> - **Current Target**: `Vivaldi.8.2.4147.28_arm64-v8a.apk`
> - **Architecture**: `arm64-v8a` (Do **NOT** use `armeabi-v7a`, `x86`, or `x86_64`)
> - **Package Name**: `com.vivaldi.browser.snapshot`
>
> <a href="https://downloads.vivaldi.com/snapshot/Vivaldi.8.2.4147.28_arm64-v8a.apk"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Vivaldi.8.2.4147.28_arm64--v8a.apk-EF3939?style=for-the-badge&logo=vivaldi&logoColor=white" alt="Download Vivaldi APK" /></a>

#### ❓ Why Vivaldi Snapshot & Future Transition to Stable

- **Extension Support & Experimental Features**: Morphe Patches currently targets **Vivaldi Snapshot** to provide native Desktop Extension support and recent Chromium components.
- **Stable Transition Roadmap**: Vivaldi Snapshot is maintained as the primary target **only until Web Extensions support is enabled by default in the stable release** of Vivaldi Browser (`com.vivaldi.browser`), at which point patch compatibility will expand/transition to the stable channel.
- **Native 64-bit Binary Offsets**: Byte-level offsets in `lib/arm64-v8a/libchrome.so` (telemetry endpoints, Crashpad, and DirectMatch suggestions) are strictly calculated against 64-bit ARM builds.

## 🔬 Technical Notes & Architecture

### 🛡️ Brave Browser: Privacy Scanner False Positives (App Manager / Exodus)

> [!NOTE]
> **Component scanners such as App Manager or Exodus Privacy may flag Google Play Billing and Google ML Kit components as "trackers" inside Brave. These are false positives caused by generic package name signatures.**

When inspecting Brave with package analysis tools, the following components may be highlighted:

| Component | Origin / Library | Actual Function | Privacy & Telemetry Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `com.android.billingclient.api.ProxyBillingActivity`<br>`com.android.billingclient.api.ProxyBillingActivityV2` | **Google Play Billing** (`billingclient`) | Handles user-initiated in-app subscriptions (Brave Leo AI Premium, Brave VPN). | **None (Transactional only).** These are trampoline UI activities for Google Play checkout sheets. They collect zero browsing analytics or telemetry. Stripping them breaks subscription handling and triggers `ActivityNotFoundException`. |
| `com.google.mlkit.common.internal.MlKitInitProvider`<br>`com.google.mlkit.common.internal.MlKitComponentDiscoveryService` | **Google ML Kit** (`mlkit.common`) | Powers local, on-device OCR and vision features (e.g. camera-based credit card scanning in Autofill and QR code scanning). | **None (On-device execution).** Flagged by Exodus because ML Kit uses the Firebase component dependency injector (`CommonComponentRegistrar`). All model operations run strictly local to the device. |

#### 🔒 Genuine Telemetry Neutralization

Genuine Brave telemetry is fully neutralized by the **[Block Brave Telemetry](#patch-catalog)** patch:
- **P3A (Privacy-Preserving Product Analytics)**: Preference getters forced to return `false` in Dalvik bytecode (`PrefService.e`).
- **Brave Stats & Web Discovery Project (WDP)**: Reporting loops disabled and all 7 telemetry endpoints redirected to `0.0.0.0` in `libchrome.so`.
- **Crashpad & Minidump Uploads**: Upload hooks aborted before dispatch (`MinidumpUploadServiceImpl`, `ChromeMinidumpUploadJobService`) and endpoints zeroed in native binary.
- **Variations Seed Fetching**: Blocked before HTTP socket creation (`IOException("Blocked by Morphe")`).

---

### 🌐 Patch Documentation: Locale PAK Slimmer (Brave & Vivaldi)

The **`Locale PAK Slimmer`** patch allows you to strip unneeded language resource PAKs from `assets/locales/` to reduce APK size (saving **~28 MB in Brave** and **~52 MB in Vivaldi**).

When configuring the **`Locales to keep`** option in Morphe Manager, specify a comma-separated list of locale codes (e.g. `es-419, es, en-US, pt-BR`). English (`en-US`) is always preserved automatically as an essential Chromium fallback. In Vivaldi, any corresponding grammatical gender variants (e.g. `es-419_FEMININE`) for your chosen languages are preserved automatically.

#### 📋 Popular Language Codes:

| Language                         | Locale Code(s)                                                                    |
