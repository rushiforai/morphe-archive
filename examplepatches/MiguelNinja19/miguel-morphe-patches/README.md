<br>

|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Free in-app purchases](#free-in-app-purchases) | When you try to buy something, the purchase is immediately marked as successful without contacting Google Play. The EA Nimble MTX system receives a null error (success) and grants the item. |  |
| [Free reward ads](#free-reward-ads) | When the game tries to show a rewarded ad, it immediately fires the ad-clicked and ad-closed callbacks without actually showing the ad. You get the reward instantly. |  |
| [Remove ads](#remove-ads) | Prevents video ads from loading. When the game tries to load an ad, nothing happens. Ads will not be shown. |  |

| [Free in-app purchases](#free-in-app-purchases) | Skips purchase signature verification and forces billing to report success. Patches RunnerBillingSecurity.verifyPurchase to always return true, Purchase.isAcknowledged/getPurchaseState to return valid values, and the billing bridge callbacks. |  |
| [Remove ads](#remove-ads) | Simulates the purchase of the 'climbnoads' IAP product by injecting a fake Purchase into the purchase list when the game queries purchases. The game finds 'climbnoads' and treats No Ads as purchased. |  |

## 🛠️ Development

### Project structure

```
miguel-morphe-patches/
├── patches/
│   ├── build.gradle.kts
│   └── src/main/kotlin/
│       ├── <package>/                  # one folder per supported app
│       │   ├── shared/
│       │   │   ├── Constants.kt         # Compatibility / target version
│       │   │   └── Fingerprints.kt      # All fingerprints for the app
│       │   └── patches/
│       │       └── <category>/
│       │           └── <PatchName>.kt
│       └── util/
│           └── PatchListGenerator.kt    # From the Morphe template
├── extensions/                          # Optional .mpe extensions
├── settings.gradle.kts
└── gradle.properties
```

### Adding a new app

1. Create a new folder under `patches/src/main/kotlin/<package>/` for the new app.
2. Add a `Constants.kt` with the `Compatibility` declaration (package name, supported versions).
3. Add a `Fingerprints.kt` with fingerprints for the methods you want to patch.
4. Add patch files under `patches/<category>/` (e.g. `unlock/`, `ads/`, `protection/`).
5. Commit with `feat: add patches for <app name>` to trigger a new release.

### Building locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MiguelNinja19/miguel-morphe-patches.git
cd miguel-morphe-patches

# Set up a GitHub PAT with read:packages scope
export GITHUB_ACTOR=<your-github-username>
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-pat>

# Build the patch bundle
./gradlew buildAndroid

# Patch an APK using Morphe CLI
java -jar morphe-cli.jar patch \
    -a app.apk \
    -p patches/build/libs/patches-*.mpp \
    -o app_patched.apk
```

### Reversing notes

Patches are derived by decompiling the target APKs with `jadx` and `apktool`:

```bash
jadx --no-res -d jadx-out app.apk
apktool d -f -r -o apk-smali app.apk
```

Fingerprints are anchored on:

- Stable string literals (SharedPreferences keys, assertion strings, layout names)
- Unique method calls (e.g. SDK internal callbacks)
- Resource name strings (`ph_ad_close_view`, `activity_relaunch_premium`, etc.)

We avoid pinning `definingClass` when possible because obfuscated class names
can change between APK versions and build configurations.
