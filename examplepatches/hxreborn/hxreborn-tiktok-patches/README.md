# hxreborn TikTok Patches

<br>

Personal TikTok patches for [Morphe](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-cli), based on [icysymmetra](https://github.com/icysymmetra)'s work. Targets `com.zhiliaoapp.musically` on [TikTok `46.2.3`](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/tiktok-pte-ltd/tik-tok-including-musical-ly/tiktok-46-2-3-release/tiktok-46-2-3-android-apk-download/).

<br>

## Install

On the device where Morphe is installed: [add to Morphe](https://morphe.software/add-source?github=hxreborn/hxreborn-tiktok-patches), or paste the repo URL as a source: `https://github.com/hxreborn/hxreborn-tiktok-patches`.

Or try a prebuilt APK (at your own risk): [hxreborn/Morphe-AutoBuilds](https://github.com/hxreborn/Morphe-AutoBuilds/releases/latest).

<br>

## Patches

Everything from [icysymmetra's upstream](https://github.com/icysymmetra/tiktok-patches-for-morphe), plus:

- Hide AI-generated posts
- Hide paid partnership and promotional content posts
- Hide in-feed account and bulletin-board suggestion cards
- Hide posts from verified accounts\*
- Disable telemetry, ByteDance/AppsFlyer/Firebase
- Hide the in-feed playlist bar
- Hide the floating promotional event badge, e.g. FIFA World Cup
- Hide suggested accounts on the Activity, New followers, and Inbox pages
- Hide the Inbox stories row
- Expand the Activity and New followers lists instead of hiding them behind View all
- Hide the BdTuring risk-control CAPTCHA dialog†
- Unlock scrolling past countdown-locked short-drama ads

\*TikTok decides which accounts count as institutions. Major news outlets usually carry that tag and
stay in your feed, but some do not and get hidden like any other verified account.

†Off by default. Enabling it suppresses the risk-control puzzle TikTok shows flagged accounts, so
follows and likes silently fail instead of prompting you to solve it.

Last synced with upstream at [`818a505`](https://github.com/icysymmetra/tiktok-patches-for-morphe/commit/818a505). Release numbers are this fork's own and do not track upstream's.
