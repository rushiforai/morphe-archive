# 🧩 Lustx Patches

> **Lustx Patches by sqzass**  
> Custom patches for use with the Morphe app patcher.

## ❓ About

**Lustx Patches** is a custom patch bundle by **sqzass**, built for compatibility with the [Morphe](https://morphe.software) patcher ecosystem and based on prior work of the Morphe and [ReVanced](https://github.com/ReVanced) projects.

### How to use these patches

Add this repository source to Morphe Manager:
`https://github.com/sqzass/lustx-patches`

## 🛠️ Tools & Development

This repository includes a local helper tool for decompiling Android apps and split packages (`.apk`, `.apks`, `.xapk`, `.apkm`, `.aab`, `.zip`) to inspect Java sources, Smali bytecode, and Android resources when developing custom patches:

- **Decompile all app packages in `apks/`**:
  ```bash
  python scripts/decompile.py
  ```

_Note: All app files placed in `apks/` are processed and automatically deleted once decompilation successfully completes._

<br>

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Allow screen recording](#allow-screen-recording) | Clears FLAG_SECURE and disables secure surfaces so the app can be screen-recorded. |  |
| [Allow screenshots](#allow-screenshots) | Clears FLAG_SECURE from window flags so the app can be captured in screenshots. |  |
| [Change package name](#change-package-name) | Renames the app package (appends ".lustx" by default) and updates custom permissions and content-provider authorities. Changing the package name can break apps that hardcode their package or authorities in code. | • Package name<br>• Update permissions<br>• Update provider authorities |
| [Custom font](#custom-font) | Overrides the app's typeface with a built-in font family. Affects explicit Typeface usage; views that never set a typeface keep the system default. | • Font family |
| [Disable boot start-up](#disable-boot-start-up) | Prevents the app from auto-starting on device boot by removing boot intent-filter actions and the RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED permission. | • Also block update start-up |
| [Hide app icon](#hide-app-icon) | Hides the app from the launcher by replacing the LAUNCHER category with DEFAULT. The app stays installed; launch it via another app or a shortcut. |  |
| [Remove PairIP](#remove-pairip) | Removes the PairIP Play licensing gate (startup license check, response validation, repeated checks and paywall/kill path). Does not bypass PairIP native virtualization or Play Integrity attestation. |  |
| [Spoof device information](#spoof-device-information) | Replaces android.os.Build device identity fields with a chosen device preset. | • Device preset<br>• Also spoof OS version |
| [Spoof install source](#spoof-install-source) | Makes the app believe it was installed from a chosen store (Play Store by default). | • Install source |
| [Strip VPN checks](#strip-vpn-checks) | Hides an active VPN from the app by neutralizing NetworkCapabilities transport/capability checks and (optionally) network-interface name checks. | • Also strip interface-name checks |
| [Strip sensitive permissions](#strip-sensitive-permissions) | Removes selected sensitive permissions from the manifest. Can break features that rely on them; enable only the groups you want stripped. | • Location<br>• Contacts & accounts<br>• SMS & call log<br>• Phone<br>• Camera & microphone<br>• Storage / media<br>• Sensors & activity<br>• Calendar<br>• Nearby devices<br>• Notifications |
| [Universal cleanup](#universal-cleanup) | Removes junk metadata files and (optionally) strips debug logging calls. | • Strip debug logging<br>• Remove Kotlin module metadata |
