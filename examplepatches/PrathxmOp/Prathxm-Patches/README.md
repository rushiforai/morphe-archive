## 📖 About

Prathxm Patches embeds a native **Stockfish 16.1 NNUE** chess engine directly into Chess.com on Android. Perform post-game reviews and run deep analysis completely offline — no external servers, no subscriptions, no limits.

All analysis overlays are **automatically disabled during live online matches** to ensure strict fair-play compliance.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why is the package larger?**  
> The patched app is ~110 MB larger because it bundles the **Stockfish 16.1 NNUE** engine binaries locally, enabling fully offline analysis at any time.
