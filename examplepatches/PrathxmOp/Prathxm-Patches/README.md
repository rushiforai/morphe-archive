## 📖 About & Features

Prathxm Patches embeds a native **Stockfish 16.1 NNUE** chess engine directly into the Chess.com Android app for fully offline analysis and game reviews. All analysis features are programmatically disabled during live online matches to ensure fair play.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **Offline Lichess Puzzles**: Complete puzzle journey map featuring millions of offline puzzles, streaking, and thematic practice.
- **Ad-Free UI & Unlocked Bots**: Banners, interstitial ads, and video promotions are removed. All Versus Bots are fully unlocked.
- **Panic Mode**: Toggle all overlays instantly.

---

## 🎮 Gestures & Panic Mode

Access features by interacting with the Chess.com logo on the main screen:
- **Tap & Hold** → Opens the settings menu.
- **Double-Tap** → Toggles **Panic Mode** (instantly hides/shows all overlays).
