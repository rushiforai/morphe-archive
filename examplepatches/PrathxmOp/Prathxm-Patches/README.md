# ♟️ Prathxm Patches

> *"You expect me to be perfect but i am full of flaws"*

Custom Morphe patches for **Chess.com**, providing a clean, ad-free experience, locally processed post-game reviews, and offline Lichess puzzle journeys.

---

## ❓ About

Prathxm Patches embeds a native **Stockfish 16.1 NNUE** chess engine directly into the app on Android. This allows you to perform post-game reviews and run analysis completely offline, without depending on external servers. 

Strictly designed in compliance with fair-play rules, all analysis assistance and visual overlays are automatically disabled during live online matches to ensure a completely fair environment.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why is the package size larger?**
> The patched app will be about 110MB larger than the default installation. This is because it includes the high-performance **Stockfish 16.1 NNUE** engine binaries locally, so you can analyze matches offline anytime.
