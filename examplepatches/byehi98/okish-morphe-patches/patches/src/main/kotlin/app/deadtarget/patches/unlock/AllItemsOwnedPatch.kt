/**
 * Dead Target: Offline Games 3D 4.183.0 (583009063) — All items owned.
 *
 * Dead Target is Unity IL2CPP: the smali layer is SDK plumbing only, every ownership decision
 * lives in `libil2cpp.so` (85,048,024 bytes, arm64-v8a, plaintext `.text`). This patch forces
 * the game's own ownership *reads* to answer "owned", so **everything unlockable reads as
 * owned** — and, because the **equip** gates below were merged in after device testing, it can
 * actually be equipped: every gun, gun skin, glove and drone shows as unlocked, can be selected,
 * equipped and used.
 *
 * **Fourteen sites, fourteen same-length in-place edits** in one file, in three merged waves:
 *  - five ownership **display** sites (guns tile, gloves, gun skins, drone tile, glove tile) from
 *    `analysis/dead-target/notes/cosmetic-unlock-targets.md`;
 *  - five gun **usability** gates (shop button, loadout repair, two record resolvers, raid-boss
 *    lock) from `analysis/dead-target/notes/gun-usable-gate.md`, merged after device testing
 *    falsified the display-only claim;
 *  - four glove/drone **equip** gates (sites 11–14) from
 *    `analysis/dead-target/notes/glove-drone-equip-gates.md`, merged after the *same*
 *    display-only failure shape was reported on device for gloves and drones.
 * Same shape as ../unlock/UnlimitedCurrencyPatch.kt and ../ads/InstantRewardedVideoPatch.kt.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * THE FOURTEEN SITES — five DISPLAY (1–5) + five GUN-USE gates (6–10)
 *                    + four GLOVE/DRONE-EQUIP gates (11–14)

 * ⚠️ Sites 1–3, 6 and 10 overwrite a **function entry**, so the stub is `mov w0,#1 ; ret`
 * (site 10 inverts it: `mov w0,#0 ; ret`, because it returns *locked*, not owned). Sites 4–5
 * and 11–14 are **mid-function inline edits**: they replace a single 4-byte `bl` instruction and
 * must NOT be given a `ret`. See SITES 4 AND 5 for the three substitute proofs that replace the
 * entry-prologue test there, and SITES 11 TO 14 for the same four-proof argument applied to the
 * four equip gates.
 *
 * ⚠️ Sites 7–9 are **neither** of those: they are 4-byte **condition-code forcing** edits on
 * one conditional branch each, joining sites 4–5 and 11–14 as the places where a 36-byte
 * verification window carries a 4-byte write. See SITES 6 TO 10 and SITES 11 TO 14. Anchor
 * length and write length are deliberately independent axes here (36 B verified / 4 B written at
 * sites 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14), so do not "normalise" one to the other.

 * Every write is **same-length in place** — 8-over-8 at sites 1–3, 6, 10, 4-over-4 at sites
 * 4–5, 7–9 and 11–14 — which is what the patcher's `lastModified`-keyed change diff detects (see
 * DELIVERY). Only 8 or 4 bytes of each 36-byte window are written; the other 28 / 32 are
 * verified and left untouched, so file length never changes.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * VA → FILE OFFSET: the +0x4000 trap
 * ============================================================================
 * ⚠️ **Il2CppDumper's `script.json` Address (and dump.cs's `VA:`) is a VIRTUAL address.**
 * Dead Target's executable LOAD segment maps `file 0x1C1273C -> VA 0x1C1673C`, i.e.
 * **delta = +0x4000**, so **file offset = VA − 0x4000**. Re-derived here from the ELF
 * program headers of the shipped library (PT_LOAD flags=R E, `p_offset=0x1C1273C`,
 * `p_vaddr=0x1C1673C`, `p_filesz=0x2F575E4`; the only other PT_LOADs are the R and RW
 * segments). dump.cs's own `Offset:` column agrees independently at site 1:
 * `// RVA: 0x21DB470 Offset: 0x21D7470 VA: 0x21DB470`. Writing at the raw VA lands
 * **+16 KB past** the intended instruction and silently corrupts the library. Same trap
 * documented in both sibling Dead Target patches.
 *
* ⚠️ That delta is **specific to the executable segment**. The other three PT_LOADs have
 * delta 0x0 / +0x8000 / +0xC000, so it must never be applied to `.data` / `.bss`. All ten
 * sites here live in the `il2cpp` section (file `0x1F78B28 … 0x4B6790C`), which carries the
 * same `VA − file = +0x4000` — re-checked per site against the shipped library, all ten
 * agree (VA − file = 0x4000 for every one).
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * ROOT CAUSE — WHY GUNS SHOWED OWNED BUT WOULD NOT LOAD (fixed on device)
 * ============================================================================
 * **The original version of this file shipped a claim that device testing disproved.** It said
 * that forcing `DSystem.IsGunUnlock` "is what makes every gun selectable and equippable", and
 * described the patch as covering equippable guns. **That was wrong, and the reason is
 * worth writing down so nobody re-derives it.**
 *
 * `IsGunUnlock` has exactly **five** callers in the whole 85 MB library (re-derived here with
 * an exhaustive BL-target scan of the executable LOAD segment — 1,554,430 `bl` instructions,
 * 69,345 distinct targets — reproducing the five branch VAs listed at SITE 1 below). **None of
 * the five is on the equip, loadout, battle-preparation or battle-spawn path.** Its only two UI
 * consumers are `GameObject.SetActive` calls inside `WeaponItemCtrl.Init` / `::Refresh`:
 *
 * ```
 * 02668a5c: bl   0x21db470        ; DSystem.IsGunUnlock(idGun)   -> w21
 * 02668ac4: and  w1, w21, #1
 * 02668ac8: mov  x0, x8           ; this._iconOwned
 * 02668ad0: bl   0x48f1c14        ; GameObject.SetActive         <-- the ONLY consumer
 * ```
 *
 * Two verified negatives close the case: neither `WeaponItemCtrl.Init` nor `::Refresh` ever
 * loads `_itemBtn` (`this+0x80`) and neither calls `UnityEngine.UI.Selectable.set_interactable`;
 * and `WeaponItemCtrl.OnClick` (VA `0x02669190`) has **no ownership guard at all**, so tapping
 * a tile always worked. The observable device symptom was therefore exactly: *gun shows as
 * owned → tapping it selects it → the action button is wired to buy/unlock → any loadout you
 * manage to build is wiped before the next battle.*
 *
 * ⇒ **Site 1 drives the inventory/shop tile DISPLAY only. Equipping and firing a gun are gated
 * separately, by sites 6–10 below.** Those five gates were added to fix exactly that, and
 * everything this file previously said about guns being equippable now rests on them instead of
 * on site 1.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * ROOT CAUSE, ROUND TWO — THE SAME SHAPE RECURRED FOR GLOVES AND DRONES
 * ============================================================================
 * **The established rule, now stated once so it is never re-learned on hardware:**
 *
 * ```
 *   A PATCHED OWNERSHIP PREDICATE PROVES DISPLAY, NEVER EQUIP.
 * ```
 *
 * Guns failed this way on device, and the fix was sites 6–10. Then the **identical** failure
 * shape was reported for **gloves** (show as owned, cannot be equipped) and for **drones** (same
 * report), and the diagnosis was the identical one: the predicates this file already patched for
 * those two categories drive the **tile icon** and nothing else.
 *
 *  - **Glove side.** Site 5 (`GloveItemCtrl.Refresh`, `0x02649228`) and site 2
 *    (`DSystem.IsOwnGlove(string)`, `0x021C5314`) are the two already-shipped glove predicates.
 *    Site 5's *only* consumer is `this._iconOwned.SetActive(owned)` at `0x0264D248`; site 2 is
 *    reached from `GlovesView.RefreshButtons` at `0x02BC0024` only to decide whether to *force
 *    hide* `Btn_Get` in one edge case. Neither ever touches `Btn_Use`.
 *  - **Drone side.** Site 4 (`DroneItemCtrl.Refresh`, `0x02631630`) likewise feeds
 *    `_iconOwned.SetActive(droneInventory.ContainsKey(DroneConfig.id))` and nothing else.
 *
 * The actual **Equip button** is gated by *separate, inlined* collection tests inside the two
 * `RefreshButtons` methods and `DroneShopView.SetupButtonEquip`. In **all three** cases the
 * not-owned branch jumps *past* the block that would show the button, so the button never
 * appears at all — which is why the user sees "owned but I cannot press Equip" rather than
 * "owned but the press does nothing". Those are sites **11, 12 and 13**.
 *
 * **What this fixes, per category:**
 *  - **Gloves need TWO independent gates** — and both are mandatory. `GlovesView.RefreshButtons`
 *    (site 11) is the **shop** entry point; `ControlGloveSkin.RefreshButtons` (site 12) is the
 *    **in-battle** glove selector, a different class with its own copy of the same algorithm
 *    (its `Btn_Use` lives at `+0x70`, not the shop's `+0x60`). Equipping from the battle screen
 *    instead of the shop bypasses site 11 entirely, so site 11 alone leaves the player stuck.
 *    This is the one place in the file where shipping half the fix would look complete and
 *    behave as if nothing had changed.
 *  - **Drones:** `SetupButtonEquip` (**site 13**) is **essential** — it is the sole gate on
 *    `_btnEquip.gameObject.SetActive(owned)`, and the literal structural twin of gun gate G1
 *    (site 6). `SetupButtonUnlock` (**site 14**) is **label text only**: it chooses the caption
 *    on the *unlock* button and does not touch visibility or interactivity, so it is the one
 *    droppable site in this file — removing it costs cosmetics and nothing else.
 *
 * **Why there is deliberately no patch on the commit path.** Both commits are
 * **unconditional field writes with no ownership read whatsoever**:
 *  - `GlovesView.BtnUse_OnClick` (`0x02BC030C`) and `ControlGloveSkin.BtnUse_OnClick`
 *    (`0x0240E494`) are each exactly `str w8,[x9,#0x490]` — `UserData.curHandSkin = handID`;
 *  - `DroneShopView.EquipClick` (`0x02BBD1F4`) tail-calls `DSystem.EquipedDrone(int)`
 *    (`0x021D5E38`), which is the two-instruction raw write `ldr x8,[x0,#0x1A0]` /
 *    `str w1,[x8,#0x118]` — `UserData.equippedDrone = id`.
 *
 * Nothing in either chain asks "do I own this?", so **once the button is visible and the tap
 * reaches it, the equip lands.** That is the whole argument for sites 11–14 being sufficient and
 * for there being nothing to patch on the commit path — the same asymmetry that made the gun
 * commit chain (`EquipGun` / `SwitchItemsEquiped` / `EquipedItems`) need no site either. The
 * gates are purely *reachability* gates.

 * a small method. The remaining anchor words decode as the game's own frame setup and
 * argument marshalling — `0xA9014FF4` `stp x20,x19,[sp,#16]`, `0xB0017A75` `adrp x21`,
 * `0x39502EA8` `ldr x8,[x21,#0xBA8]` (metadata init guard), and crucially
 * **`0x2A0103F3` = `mov x19,x1` at +0x10**, which is `idGun` — proof the anchor really is
 * the top of `IsGunUnlock` and not a lookalike prologue in a neighbouring method.
 *
 * `IsGunUnlock` is not a flag read: its body *is* the ownership test, and it is
 * `UserData.inventory.ContainsKey(idGun)` — **not** a `gunList` scan. Re-decoded from the
 * shipped bytes: `ldr x8,[this+0x1A0]` (the UserData holder field, same `#0x1A0` offset the
 * currency getters in ../unlock/UnlimitedCurrencyPatch.kt read) → `ldr x0,[x8,#0xE8]` =
 * `UserData.inventory`, a `Dictionary<int,int>` → `mov w1,w19` → frame teardown → a **tail**-`b`
 * to `0x36C6420`, the shared generic `Dictionary<int,int>.ContainsKey(int)`. The last words of
 * the window are exactly that shape: `+0x50 0xF9400102` `ldr x2,[x8]`,
 * `+0x54 0xA8C257FE` `ldp x30,x21,[sp],#32` (frame torn down first), then
 * `+0x58 0x1453ABD6` `b 0x36C6420` — so the function's own return value is
 * `inventory.ContainsKey(idGun)`.
 *
 * (Correction to an earlier draft of this file, which described this as
 * `List<int>.Contains` over a `gunList` backing array. `0x36C6420` is provably the *shared
 * generic* `Dictionary<int,int>.ContainsKey` — it is the very same tail target site 3 uses at
 * `0x021D5C0C` — so sites 1 and 3 are byte-for-byte the same predicate at two entry points.)
 *
 * Forcing it to `true` therefore makes every gun id read as owned **through this one entry
 * point** — but "through this one entry point" is the whole limit: the five callers listed
 * below are the complete consumer set, and they are display/cleanup, not equip.
 *
 * The call graph was established by an **exhaustive BL-target scan of the entire executable
 * LOAD segment** (every 4-byte word decoded as a BL, sign-extended imm26 × 4 added back to
 * the branch VA). Exactly **5** call sites target VA 0x021DB470 — no more, no fewer — and
 * all five resolve to methods named in dump.cs:
 *
 *  | Caller                                                       | Branch VA | dump.cs RVA of containing method |
 *  |--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
 *  | WeaponItemCtrl.Init(ItemConfig,int) — the inventory/loadout   | 0x02668A5C| 0x2668860 |
 *  | WeaponItemCtrl.Refresh(int) — the inventory/loadout           | 0x0266955C| 0x26693C8 |
 *  | DSystem.CheckRestoreAllGunHasSkin()                           | 0x021DB930| 0x21DB4D0 |
 *  | DSystem.RemoveGun(int)                                        | 0x021DB42C| 0x21DB394 |
 *  | ConfigLazyEvent4BattlePassRecord.GetBattlePassRewardId(...)   | 0x023C45FC| 0x23C43D4 |
 *
 *  (Branch-VA list re-measured in this pass — matches the table above exactly. For contrast,
 *  the same scan finds 32 callers of `CheckHaveGun` and 9 of `WeaponShopView.IsOwnedItem`.)
 *
 * Per-caller consequence:
 *  - **`WeaponItemCtrl::Init` / `::Refresh` are the point of site 1.** The boolean feeds
 *    `and w1,w21,#1` and then `GameObject.SetActive` on `this._iconOwned` — the per-slot
 *    "is this gun owned" flag that drives the tile's owned icon. Forcing it true makes **the
 *    tile show as owned, and nothing else**; it does not enable, unlock or equip anything. See
 *    ROOT CAUSE above and sites 6–10 below for the equip/use gates it does not cover.
 *  - `DSystem::CheckRestoreAllGunHasSkin` — a save-repair routine; it will now consider every
 *    gun owned. Harmless (see `RemoveGun` below).
 *  - `DSystem::RemoveGun` — used as a `tbz w0,#0` guard before `inventory.Remove(idGun)`.
 *    Forcing the predicate true lets the removal proceed for ids that are not in the
 *    dictionary. **Verified safe:** `Dictionary.Remove` on an absent key is a documented no-op
 *    (no exception, no index shift), so this cannot corrupt `inventory` or the save file. It is
 *    also the pre-existing behaviour for a gun you actually own, which the game calls all
 *    the time.
 *  - `ConfigLazyEvent4BattlePassRecord::GetBattlePassRewardId` — **the one behavioural side
 *    effect**: battle-pass reward selection also sees everything as owned, so it may skip
 *    reward ids it would otherwise offer. Cosmetic and confined to battle-pass reward
 *    choice; nothing crashes and no currency is granted by this patch. Site 3 lands on the
 *    other leg of this same AND — see BATTLE-PASS CONSEQUENCE.

 *
 * Word 0 is a genuine entry prologue: on disk `FE 0F 1D F8` = LE word **0xF81D0FFE** =
 * `str x30,[sp,#-0x30]!`. The frame then continues `stp x22,x21,[sp,#0x10]` /
 * `stp x20,x19,[sp,#0x20]`, an `adrp`-pair and the usual metadata-init guard flag test
 * (`ldr w8,[x22,#0x406]` / `tbnz w8,#0`).
 *
 * **Argument-register proof: `0xF40301AA` = `mov x20,x1` at VA 0x021C9330 (entry + 0x1C).**
 * `x1` is the first declared parameter, i.e. `Il2CppString* glovename` (`mov x19,x0` at
 * +0x20 is `this`). This is what distinguishes the anchor from the other prologues sharing
 * those first 12 bytes — and it is the exact analogue of the `mov x19,x1` proof used at
 * site 1. Note the 16- and 20-byte windows are **ambiguous (2 hits)**: the other hit is
 * `DSystem.GetSkinIndex(string,string)` (VA 0x021C91C0), a near-identical two-`Il2CppString*`
 * method. Only 24 bytes and up are unique, so 36 is not gold-plating here — see ANCHOR
 * UNIQUENESS.
 *
 * **Not a dead end:** first 8 bytes `FE0F1DF8F65701A9` ≠ `20008052C0035FD6`.

 * ============================================================================
 * SITE 3 — `DProject.DSystem.CheckHaveGun(int idGunRecommend)` (SKINS) — entry stub
 * ============================================================================
 *  VA        : 0x021D5BB4
 *  file off. : 0x021D1BB4
 *  signature : internal bool DProject_DSystem__CheckHaveGun (DProject_DSystem_o* __this,
 *              int32_t idGunRecommend, const MethodInfo* method);
 *
 * Word 0 is a genuine entry prologue: on disk `FE 57 BE A9` = LE word **0xA9BE57FE** =
 * `stp x30,x21,[sp,#-0x20]!`, the frameless-leaf frame — the same word 0 as site 1.
 *
 * **Argument-register proof: `0xF303012A` = `mov w19,w1` at VA 0x021D5BC4 (entry + 0x10).**
 * `w1` is `idGunRecommend` (`mov x20,x0` at +0x14 is `this`).
 *
 * **Not a dead end:** first 8 bytes `FE57BEA9F44F01A9` ≠ `20008052C0035FD6`.
 *
 * The body is a read of two fields then a **tail branch**:
 * `ldr x8,[x20,#0x1A0]` (`DSystem+0x1A0` = UserData) → `ldr x0,[x8,#0xE8]`
 * (`UserData+0xE8` = `inventory`, a `Dictionary<int,int>`) → `mov w1,w19` → frame teardown →
 * `b 0x036C6420`, i.e. `Dictionary<int,int>.ContainsKey(int)`. That target is the **same**
 * shared generic instantiation site 1 tail-branches to (`0x021DB4C8: b 0x36C6420`) — so
 * `CheckHaveGun` and `IsGunUnlock` are byte-for-byte the same predicate
 * (`inventory.ContainsKey(id)`) at two different entry points.
 *
 * **Why this is the skin gate (evidence chain, all byte-verified):** `SkinData`
 * (TypeDefIndex 1566) is `{ int GunID @0x10; int CurrentIndex @0x14; Dictionary<int,int>
 * PartInfo @0x18 }`. `SkinData.IsEnable(int skinIndex)` @ `0x024B1A44` resolves
 * `ConfigWeapon.GetConfigByID(this.GunID)` and then **tail-branches to
 * `DSystem.CheckHaveGun(GunID)`** — `0x024B1D44: ldr w1,[x19,#0x10]` (this.GunID),
 * `0x024B1D5C: b 0x21D5BB4`. (When the gun config cannot be resolved it instead returns
 * `true` already, `0x024B1D60: mov w0,#1` — verified.) And `GunSkinItemCtrl.UpdateStatus`
 * (VA `0x0264D6DC`) computes its owned flag as `SkinData.IsEnable(_skinId)` then
 * **overwrites it with `DSystem.CheckHaveGun(gunId)`** at VA `0x0264D8CC`, before
 * `_iconOwned.SetActive(w20 & 1)` at `0x0264D8E4`. `WeaponSkinView.Refresh()` reaches it at
 * `0x020B02EC`.
 *
 * **⇒ In Dead Target, gun-skin ownership IS gun ownership.** That is exactly why site 3 is
 * needed and site 1 alone is not enough: site 1 covers `IsGunUnlock`, and this skin UI path
 * calls the *other* copy of the same predicate.
 *
 * **32 call sites, all reads** — the same predicate site 1 already forces, so no new
 * behaviour class appears, with three families worth naming:
 *  - **`WeaponSkinView.Refresh`, `GunSkinItemCtrl.UpdateStatus`** — the reason to patch. Every
 *    gun-skin tile shows the owned tick. ✔
 *  - **`WeaponItemCtrl.Init/Refresh`, `SetupCharm`, gun-trial lists** — the same predicate
 *    site 1 already forces via `IsGunUnlock`. No new behaviour.
 *  - **Sale / offer surfaces** (`DSystem.IsGunSale`, `ControlMap2D.ShowSaleGun`,
 *    `ControlMapView.ShowSaleGun`, `ConfigOfferBaseOnGun.*`,
 *    `ConfigWeaponSaleIAP.PassConditionWeapon`, `ShowAdAtLose.ShowItemByLoseCount`, the
 *    `ControlPointMap2D*`/`ControlMap2D` timers and notices) — stop advertising guns you
 *    "already own". Cosmetic and self-consistent.
 *  - **Quest / medal / notice reads** (`QuestManager.IsMatchCondition`,
 *    `MedalSystemHelper.GetFeatGoText`, `UserData.GetWeaponNoticeText`,
 *    `MissionInfoView.RefreshBtnRecommend` / `OnBuyClick`) — read-only.
 *
 * One real, if minor, functional change: `GunTrainManager.GetListGunCanTrial` /
 * `CreateGunTrialMission` shrink, i.e. the gun-trial feature becomes largely inert. Nothing
 * needs trialling when everything is owned, and this is the same trade site 1 already made.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * SITES 4 AND 5 — MID-FUNCTION INLINE EDITS, NOT ENTRY STUBS
 * ============================================================================
 * ⚠️ **Read this before copying either site.** Neither of these is a function entry, so the
 * argument used at sites 1–3 — "word 0 is a genuine prologue" — **does not apply and is not
 * used here**. Overwriting a mid-body offset with `mov w0,#1 ; ret` would return from the
 * middle of `Refresh` with an unbalanced stack frame and a live prologue left unexecuted; it
 * is exactly the bug an entry-stub rationale invites. Instead each site replaces **one 4-byte
 * `bl` word with the 4-byte `mov w0,#1`**, which is stack-neutral: the enclosing method runs
 * from its own entry exactly as before, its frame is pushed and popped normally, and only the
 * boolean this one call would have returned is forced.
 *
 * The reason they are mid-body at all: `DSystem.IsOwnedDrone()` takes **no id parameter** and
 * `GloveItemCtrl` does not call `IsOwnGlove` — so the IL2CPP compiler **inlined** the
 * per-item collection test into each tile's `Refresh`. There is no callable entry to stub.
 * (The alternative "predicates" were evaluated and rejected: see VERIFIED DEAD ENDS AND
 * REJECTED TARGETS.)
 *
 * ---- SITE 4 — DRONES: `DroneItemCtrl.Refresh` inline `droneInventory.ContainsKey` ----
 * Containing method: `DroneItemCtrl` (TypeDefIndex 2249), `Refresh(int selectedIndex)`
 * VA `0x02635550`; the site is at method + 0xE0.
 *
 * Four substitute proofs that this `bl` is the right instruction, none of which is a
 * prologue argument:
 *
 * 1. **Word 0 decodes as a `BL` to the shared generic.** LE `0x9442437C` → `bl #+0x1090DF0`
 *    → target **`0x036C6420`**, which is provably the shared generic
 *    `Dictionary<int,int>.ContainsKey(int)`: it is the *same* function site 1
 *    (`0x021DB4C8: b 0x36C6420`), site 3 (`0x021D5C0C: b 0x36C6420`) and
 *    `SkinData.isOwnSkin` (`0x024B27EC: b 0x36C6420`) tail-branch to. Re-decoded from the
 *    library bytes, not taken on trust.
 * 2. **The collection is pinned by the preceding load.** `0x02635618: ldr x0,[x9,#0xF0]`
 *    (re-decoded as `0xF9407920`) = `UserData+0xF0` =
 *    `public Dictionary<int,int> droneInventory`, whereas guns use `UserData+0xE8 inventory`
 *    and gloves `UserData+0x488 listHandSkin`. There is only one `droneInventory` read in
 *    this method.
 * 3. **The id argument is in `w1`, as `ContainsKey(int)` requires.**
 *    `0x02635628: ldr w1,[x8,#0x10]` = `DroneConfig.id`. The instruction before the `bl`
 *    (`0x0263562C: ldr x2,[x9]`) is the method-table argument, i.e. the generic shape.
 * 4. **The result flows straight into `_iconOwned.SetActive`.**
 *    `0x02635634: ldr x8,[x19,#0x40]` = `this._iconOwned`, `0x0263563C: and w1,w0,#1`
 *    consumes the bool, `0x02635648: bl 0x048F1C14` = `GameObject.SetActive`. Forcing
 *    `w0 = 1` therefore changes the tile's owned icon and nothing else in the method.
 *
 * `DroneItemCtrl.Refresh` has exactly one caller, `DroneShopView.RefreshDroneItems()` at
 * branch VA `0x02BBC564` (re-decoded, confirmed). `droneInventory` itself is never written by
 * this patch, so the owned-drone dictionary and the save file are untouched.
 * ⚠️ `DroneItemCtrl.OnClick` (VA `0x026353D0`, reached through a Unity button delegate, so
 * it has no BL caller) was disassembled and contains **no ownership guard** — it fires a
 * `DroneShopUIActionEvent` query and navigates. Clicking a now-"owned" tile therefore routes
 * to the normal shop flow rather than a buy flow. That is the desired outcome, but it means
 * site 4 changes **routing, not just an icon** — see HONEST SCOPE.
 *
 * ---- SITE 5 — GLOVES tile icon: `GloveItemCtrl.Refresh` inline `listHandSkin.Contains` ----
 * Containing method: `GloveItemCtrl` (TypeDefIndex 2292), `Refresh(int selectedIndex)`
 * VA `0x0264D178`; the site is at method + 0xB0.
 *
 * **Site 2 alone does not light up the per-glove shop tile**, because `GloveItemCtrl` inlines
 * the same test instead of calling `IsOwnGlove`. If "every glove tile shows as owned" is
 * required, this is the second glove site; included for that reason.
 *
 * Substitute proofs, same shape as site 4:
 *
 * 1. **Word 0 decodes as a `BL` to `List<int>.Contains`.** LE `0x945671F7` →
 *    `bl #+0x159C7DC` → target **`0x03BE9A04`**, the shared generic `List<int>.Contains(int)`
 *    — provably the same function `DSystem.IsOwnGlove(int)` tail-branches to
 *    (`0x021DB2C0: b 0x3be9a04`). Re-decoded from the library bytes.
 * 2. **The collection is pinned by the preceding load.** `0x0264D210: ldr x0,[x8,#0x488]`
 *    (re-decoded as `0xF9424500`) = `UserData+0x488` = `listHandSkin` (`List<int>`).
 * 3. **The id argument is in `w1`.** `0x0264D220: ldr w1,[x19,#0x70]` = `this._gloveId`;
 *    `0x0264D224: ldr x2,[x8]` is the method-table argument again.
 * 4. **The result flows into `_iconOwned.SetActive`.** `0x0264D234: ldr x8,[x19,#0x48]` =
 *    `this._iconOwned`, `0x0264D23C: and w1,w0,#1`, `0x0264D248: bl 0x048F1C14`.
 *
 * `GloveItemCtrl.Refresh` has exactly one caller, `GlovesView.RefreshGloveItems()` at branch
 * VA `0x02BBF5B0` (re-decoded, confirmed). No write to `listHandSkin`. Read-only. ✔
 *
 * Note the surrounding code already contains a literal `mov w0,#1` at `0x0264D230` — the
 * game's own "gloveId == 0 ⇒ owned" shortcut (`cbz w21` at `0x0264D1F8` branches there).
 * That is why this anchor's hex contains `20008052` at offset **+0x08**. Harmless: the
 * replacement is written at +0x00 and the anchor is only ever compared, never written.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * SITES 6 TO 10 — GUN USABILITY: TWO ENTRY STUBS, THREE CONDITION-CODE EDITS
 * ============================================================================
 * These are the five gates that sit between "the tile shows as owned" and "the gun can be
 * equipped and fired". Every one of them reads the **same** collection as site 1 —
 * `UserData.inventory` (`Dictionary<int,int>` at `UserData+0xE8`) — through a *different* call
 * path, which is exactly why patching one copy of the predicate is not enough. Source:
 * `analysis/dead-target/notes/gun-usable-gate.md`.
 *
 * Two mechanical kinds live here, and they must not be conflated:
 *  - **Sites 6 and 10 are entry stubs** (`mov w0,#1 ; ret` / `mov w0,#0 ; ret`): overwrite a
 *    function prologue, same as sites 1–3, stack never touched.
 *  - **Sites 7, 8 and 9 are mid-function branch edits**: they replace ONE 4-byte conditional
 *    branch word. Never give these a `ret` — the enclosing method must run to completion, or
 *    its frame is left unbalanced. All three carry a **36-byte verification window with a 4-byte
 *    write**, the same axis separation sites 4–5 already use.
 *
 * ---- SITE 6 — `WeaponShopView.IsOwnedItem(int idItem)` — entry stub, always owned ----
 *  VA 0x020A8708 · file 0x020A4708 · write 8 B (entry) · anchor 36 B
 *
 * Genuine entry (`0xA9BE57FE` `stp x30,x21,[sp,#-0x20]!`; `mov w19,w1` = idItem at +0x10,
 * `mov x20,x0` = this at +0x14). Body: `ldr x0,[x20,#0x1E8]` → null check →
 * `mov w1,w19` → tail-`b 0x36C6420`, i.e. `Dictionary<int,int>.ContainsKey`. Field `0x1E8` is
 * `WeaponShopView._data.Inventory` (`_data` is a by-value copy of `UIState.WeaponShopData` at
 * `+0x1D8`, `Inventory` at `Data+0x10`), which `UIState.UpdateWeaponShopData` fills straight
 * from `UserData.inventory` (`0x02B6786C ldr x8,[x8,#0xe8]` → `0x02B67870 str x8,[x19,#0x38]`).
 * **So this is byte-for-byte the same predicate as site 1, reached without a call.**
 *
 * It is the shop's **only** ownership predicate: 9 BL callers, all gun-shop UI, re-measured
 * here (`SetStatusButton` 0x020A7B38, `SetupCharm` 0x020A8198, `SetupBtnForProgressRoadWeapon`
 * 0x020A89D4, `GetCurPrice` 0x020A90E0, `SetupBtnForCraftWeapon` 0x020A9838,
 * `SetupBtnForNormalWeapon` 0x020AA0C8, `GetCurrentBulletText` 0x020AAC90, `BuyAmmo` 0x020AAFE8,
 * `GetCurTypePrice` 0x020AC034). The one that matters is `SetupBtnForNormalWeapon`:
 *
 * ```
 *  020aa0c8: bl   0x20a8708            ; IsOwnedItem(ItemConfig.id)      <-- site 6
 *  020aa0cc: tbz  w0, #0x0, 0x20aa520  ; NOT owned -> buy/unlock button wiring
 *  020aa0d0: ldr  x0, [x19, #0xf0]     ; owned:     _lbGunLocked
 *  020aa0ec: bl   0x48f1c14            ;   SetActive(false)
 * ```
 *
 * ⇒ site 6 picks the **Equip/Upgrade** button layout instead of the **Unlock/Buy** one. Without
 * it a gun that site 1 already displays as owned still gets the buy button.
 *
 * ---- SITE 7 — `DSystem.FixedWrongEquipWeapon()` — unconditional "keep the slot" (4 B) ----

 * `SkinTrialManager.CreateNewEquipItem` 0x02AC00E0, …) — i.e. every time battle preparation
 * opens **and** on entering a game — and it silently overwrites any equipped slot whose gun id
 * is absent from `inventory`.
 *
 * `tbnz w0,#0,+0x28` → **`b +0x28`** (`0A000014`) makes the branch unconditional, i.e. always
 * take the "keep the slot" path. `nop` would be wrong here: it would fall straight *into* the
 * repair block. Re-decoded, the forced branch target `0x021D290C + 0x28 = 0x021D2934` is
 * byte-identical to the original `tbnz` target, so the loop converges on exactly the same code
 * a genuinely-owned gun takes — the counter `sub w22,w22,#1` and the loop back-edge at
 * `0x021D2938` are reached identically, and the routine's remaining work (armour handling, and
 * the trailing `equipedItems[0]=2 / [1]=1` fill at `0x021D2950`) is untouched. The only
 * behaviour removed is the "replace an un-owned equipped gun with gun 1 or 2" rewrite, which is
 * the bug. Nothing else in the function is written.
 *
 * Side effect to be aware of, not a hazard: the routine also contains a "refill the `-1`
 * empty-slot sentinel" pass at `0x021D2F44…0x021D2FD4`, inside `GetCurEquipedGunBattle`. Site 7
 * does not touch it, and it still runs.

 * which is the instruction immediately after the branch — so `nop` is exactly right (as opposed
 * to site 7, whose fall-through is the *bad* path). The `UpgradeWeaponRecord` the gun is built

 *
 * Same shape on the battle-preparation path, and this is the one that crashes: the record
 * returned by sites 8/9 is dereferenced without a null check —
 *
 * ```
 *  020ff4fc: ldr  x0, [x24]
 *  020ff500: bl   0x32f5954       ; DSystem.GetCurEquipedGun(indexEquip)
 *  020ff504: cbz  x0, 0x2102ce4   ; -> il2cpp_null_reference_throw  (NullReferenceException)
 * ```
 *
 * i.e. `GunController.Init` treats `null` as fatal, not as "fall back", so without sites 8/9 a
 * freshly equipped un-owned gun degrades into a thrown `NullReferenceException` during gun
 * construction. Both sites are reached from the live path: `DSystem.GetCurEquipedGun(int)`
 * tail-`b`s to `GetCurEquipedGunBattle` at `0x021D1D28` and to `GetOwnedGunConfigById` at
 * `0x021D1E3C` (site 8 has **0** BL callers precisely because it is only ever tail-called).
 *
 * **What makes sites 8/9 safe** (this is the load-bearing asymmetry, re-decoded here): the level
 * lookup they both call already tolerates an absent id. `DUtil.GetLevelItem(int)` @ `0x028DDE68`
 * does `inventory.ContainsKey(id)` and, on the not-owned path, returns a **static default level**
 * read from `DSystem`'s static-field slot (`0x028DDF48 ldr x8,[x0,#0xb8]` →
 * `0x028DDF50 ldr w0,[x8,#0x20]`) — it does not throw and does not return `null`. So forcing
 * sites 8/9 past their early-outs yields a *well-formed* `UpgradeWeaponRecord` at the default
 * level, with no other change needed.

 *  VA 0x0206B9A8 · file 0x020679A8 · write 8 B (entry) · anchor 36 B
 *
 * Genuine entry (same `stp x30,x21` word 0 as sites 1/3/6; `mov w19,w1` = itemId at +0x18,
 * `mov x20,x0` = this at +0x1C). Body ends `mvn w8,w0 ; and w0,w8,#1`, i.e. it returns
 * **`!inventory.ContainsKey(itemId)`** — so the constant here is **false**, not true:
 * `00008052 C0035FD6` = `mov w0,#0 ; ret`. That is the only site in this file whose stub
 * returns zero; the direction is easy to get backwards, so it is called out here.
 *
 * 3 BL callers, all in the raid-boss mode item list (`0x0206B0BC`, `0x0206B8C4`, `0x0206BB04`).
 * **Scope-limited**: it affects raid-boss mode only, and is the one gate here that is *mode*-scoped
 * rather than global. Included because the goal is "guns usable", it is the same predicate over
 * the same collection as the other four, and it is verified unique and disjoint. If raid-boss
 * mode is out of scope, this site can be dropped without affecting the other nine.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * SITES 11 TO 14 — GLOVE AND DRONE EQUIP GATES: FOUR MID-FUNCTION INLINE EDITS
 * ============================================================================
 * These are the glove/drone half of the gun finding, and mechanically they are the **same kind**
 * of site as sites 4–5: a single 4-byte `bl` word replaced by the 4-byte `mov w0,#1`, with **no
 * `ret`**, 36 bytes verified and 4 written. So the same four substitute proofs apply (the
 * "word 0 is a genuine prologue" argument is inapplicable to all four, for the same reason), and
 * they are given once here rather than repeated per site. Source:
 * `analysis/dead-target/notes/glove-drone-equip-gates.md`.
 *
 *  1. **Word 0 decodes as a `BL` to the shared generic collection helper** — re-decoded from the
 *     library bytes, not taken on trust:
 *
 *     | Site | file word | LE word | target | helper |
 *     |---|---|---|---|---|
 *     | 11 | `F2 A6 40 94` | `0x9460A6F2` | `0x03BE9A04` | `List<int>.Contains` |
 *     | 12 | `68 6E 5F 94` | `0x945F6E68` | `0x03BE9A04` | `List<int>.Contains` |
 *     | 13 | `D0 25 2C 94` | `0x942C25D0` | `0x036C6420` | `Dictionary<int,int>.ContainsKey` |
 *     | 14 | `80 25 2C 94` | `0x942C2580` | `0x036C6420` | `Dictionary<int,int>.ContainsKey` |
 *
 *     `0x03BE9A04` is the *same* function site 5 replaces and that `DSystem.IsOwnGlove(int)`
 *     tail-branches to (`0x021DB2C0: b 0x3be9a04`); `0x036C6420` is the *same* shared generic
 *     sites 1, 3, 6, 7 and 8 all route through. Identical helper to the already-proven sites.
 *  2. **The receiver is pinned by the collection load inside the anchor.** Sites 11/12 carry
 *     `ldr x0,[x8,#0x488]` = `UserData+0x488` = `listHandSkin` (`List<int>`) at −0x18; sites
 *     13/14 carry `ldr x0,[x8,#0xF0]` = `UserData+0xF0` = `droneInventory`
 *     (`Dictionary<int,int>`) at −0x18. Both loads are reached from `ldr x8,[x0,#0x1A0]`,
 *     i.e. `DSystem.userData`.
 *  3. **The id argument is in `w1`**, as `Contains`/`ContainsKey` require — `ldr w1,[x20,#0x10]`
 *     = `HandSkinRecord.handID` (sites 11/12) or `DroneConfig.idItem` (sites 13/14), 4 bytes
 *     before the `bl` in every case.
 *  4. **The result is consumed immediately**, which is what makes the write meaningful — see the
 *     per-site disassembly below.

 *  ```
 *
 * **Proof the not-owned branch never shows the button:** the only `Btn_Use.gameObject.SetActive`
 * in the method is `0x02BBFF08`, which lies strictly *inside* the owned block, while the
 * not-owned target `0x02BBFF38` lies past it, and there is no `Btn_Use.SetActive(false)`
 * anywhere on the not-owned path — the button is simply left as `PreRender` left it, i.e.
 * hidden. Established by an exhaustive `bl` scan of the method range `0x02BBFCD0 … 0x02BC0120`:
 * `set_interactable` (`0x4b44ca4`) is called exactly once and `GameObject.SetActive`
 * (`0x48f1c14`) four times, of which only `0x02BBFF08` targets `+0x60`.
 *
 * `Btn_Use.SetActive(true)` is then the **last** thing that reads the forced value: `tbz` is
 * never taken, execution falls into `ldr w21,[x20,#0x10]` at `0x02BBFE44`, and the shared tail
 * at `0x02BBFF40` additionally runs with `w24 = 1` (owned) rather than `w23 = 1`, which flips
 * `Btn_Del_Cheat` / `Btn_Get_Cheat` visibility. **Those two remain hidden anyway** — both are
 * ANDed with the `DSystem+0x5DA` dev-flag byte — so this site cannot expose a cheat button.

 * ⚠️ **THIS IS THE ONE DROPPABLE SITE IN THE FILE.** It changes `DLabel.set_text` on the *unlock*

 * `_btnUnlock` visibility, not interactivity, not the equip path. It is included so the button
 * reads as already-owned rather than quoting a price for something the player is about to be
 * told they own. Deleting this single [ItemAnchor] entry from [ARM64_ITEM_ANCHORS] reverts it
 * with no effect on sites 11, 12, 13 or on any other patch.
 *
 * **Consumer honesty for all four:** sites 11–14 write **no state at all** —
 * `UserData.listHandSkin` and `UserData.droneInventory` are never touched — so they are the same
 * class of change as the rest of this file, and they inherit the same "read patch, nothing
 * persists" limit (see HONEST SCOPE). With site 14 in place an un-owned drone shows a working
 * Equip button *and* an owned-style caption; with site 14 removed it shows a working Equip button
 * next to a price caption, which is cosmetically odd but functionally identical.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * THE LEVEL-GATE QUESTION — THERE IS NO LEVEL GATE (rejected on evidence)
 * ============================================================================
 * *"Can we bypass the level requirement, or something?"* — asked directly. **There is nothing to
 * bypass, and this is a finding, not an omission.** Two independent lines of evidence:
 *
 *  1. **Neither config type has any level field.** `HandSkinRecord` (TypeDefIndex 814,
 *     dump.cs:27051) has 28 fields and not one of them is a level: the nearest numerics are
 *     cosmetic or a different kind of gate — `numOfPart` (`0x40`, part count), `inChallengeMode`
 *     (`0x42`, mode flag), `clipSizeExt` (`0x44`, magazine-size bonus).
 *     `DroneConfig` (TypeDefIndex 794, dump.cs:26175) has 18 fields and likewise none: only
 *     `price` / `priceType` / `priceSale` / `priceUnlock` and `normalPart` / `specialPart`.
 *  2. **No such field name exists anywhere in `dump.cs` for these types.** A case-insensitive
 *     sweep of the whole 34.5 MB dump for `unlockLevel|minLevel|requireLevel|levelLimit|
 *     openLevel|levelUnlock|needLevel|maxLevel` returns no hit on any glove or drone type. The
 *     only `levelUnlock` in the game belongs to `GunInfos` (`0x16`, with
 *     `GetLevelUnlockByID`) — i.e. **gun skins**, a different item family; the `maxLevel` hits
 *     belong to `ConfigCardRecord` / `ConfigCardRarityRecord` / `SpecialCondition`.
 *
 * ⇒ **The only thing standing between an un-owned glove or drone and the Equip button is the
 * collection-membership test, and sites 11–14 are those tests.** There is no level comparison
 * on the glove or drone path, so no level override could help even in principle.
 *
 * **And a global `DSystem.get_level()` override — the tempting "bigger hammer" — was measured
 * and rejected, not assumed.** `get_level()` (RVA `0x0219E830`) is a three-instruction getter
 * (`ldr x8,[x0,#0x1A0]` / `ldr w0,[x8,#0x84]` / `ret`) for `UserData.level`, but it is the
 * game's single account-level accessor: an exhaustive direct-branch scan finds **98 branch sites**
 * (96 `BL` + 2 `B`) feeding XP curves, mission and rank gating, progression rewards, tutorial and
 * mode unlocks, analytics, and mode-specific loadout logic. Forcing it high would desynchronise
 * level from XP and could trip level-up side effects, for **zero gain** — skins are gated by the
 * `GunInfos.levelUnlock` *config* field, not by `get_level()`. **Rejected: blast radius is two
 * orders of magnitude larger than four 4-byte edits, and it buys nothing.** Do not retry this as
 * "future-proofing".
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * ⚠️ DISASSEMBLY TRAP — `cset ne` mis-renders as `csinc …, eq`. NO FIFTH GATE.
 * ============================================================================
 * **Recorded because getting it wrong manufactures a phantom site.** `llvm-objdump -M no-aliases`
 * renders the word `0xE1079F1A` as
 *
 * ```
 *   2bbfee0: csinc  w1, wzr, wzr, eq      ;   reads as w1 = (handID == curHandSkin)
 * ```
 *
 * Taken at face value that **inverts the condition** and would imply `Btn_Use` is interactable
 * only when the glove is *already* equipped — i.e. a plausible-looking **fifth, separate gate**
 * needing a fifth patch site. **It is not real, and there is no fifth gate.** Bit-exact decode of
 * the CSEL/CSINC family (`sf 00 11010100 Rm cond op2 Rn Rd`; `cond` = bits 15:12) gives
 * `cond = 0b0001 = NE`. Confirmed by round trip through the assembler:
 *
 * ```
 *   cset w1, ne  => [0xe1,0x07,0x9f,0x1a]  == the bytes on disk (E1 07 9F 1A)   ✓
 *   cset w1, eq  => [0xe1,0x17,0x9f,0x1a]  == NOT what is there
 * ```
 *
 * Cross-checked against the library's own three uses of the word, which is what settles the
 * direction rather than the encoding table:
 *
 *  | VA | file bytes | truth | meaning |
 *  |---|---|---|---|
 *  | `0x0264D1D4` | `E1 17 9F 1A` | `cset w1, eq` | `GloveItemCtrl.Refresh`: `_selected.SetActive(_index == selectedIndex)` — correct, the highlight shows on the selected tile |
 *  | `0x02BBFEE0` | `E1 07 9F 1A` | `cset w1, **ne**` | site 11: `Btn_Use.set_interactable(handID != curHandSkin)` |
 *  | `0x0240E104` | `E1 07 9F 1A` | `cset w1, **ne**` | site 12: `Btn_Use.set_interactable(handID != curHandSkin)` |
 *
 * So the correct reading is the ordinary "you may press Use unless you already have it on", and
 * **sites 11 and 12 are complete on their own.** Anyone re-deriving this must decode the
 * condition by hand or run objdump **without** `-M no-aliases`, and must not "discover" a fifth
 * gate here. (`llvm-mc`'s *alias text* is itself unreliable — it prints `ne` for the `eq`
 * spelling — but its **encodings** agree with objdump's, which is why the round trip above is
 * trustworthy and its prose is not.)
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * REPLACEMENT STUBS
 * ============================================================================
 * Entry stubs (sites 1–3, 6) — `mov w0,#1 ; ret` = `20 00 80 52 | C0 03 5F D6` (8 bytes):
 *  - `mov w0,#1` → `20 00 80 52` (0x52800020). The bool return value comes back in **w0**
 *    (AArch64 ABI, 32-bit return), so this is the correct register.
 *  - `ret`        → `C0 03 5F D6` (0xD65F03C0).
 *
 * Inverted entry stub (site 10) — `mov w0,#0 ; ret` = `00 00 80 52 | C0 03 5F D6` (8 bytes):
 *  - `mov w0,#0` → `00 00 80 52` (0x52800000). `CheckItemLocked` returns *locked*, so the
 *    forcing constant is `false`. Occurrence count over the whole library: **0** — the IL2CPP
 *    compiler never emits this pair, so unlike the `mov w0,#1 ; ret` stub it is not
 *    "self-corroborating". That is fine (uniqueness is required of the *original* anchor, which
 *    site 10 has), but it is why this stub's encoding was cross-checked with `llvm-mc` instead
 *    of being read off the library.
 *
 * Inline stubs (sites 4–5, 11–14) — `mov w0,#1` = `20 00 80 52` (4 bytes) only. **No `ret`**: the
 * enclosing `Refresh` / `RefreshButtons` / `SetupButton*` must keep running — at sites 4–5 so it
 * can load `_iconOwned` and call `SetActive`, and at sites 11–14 so it can reach the
 * `Btn_Use` / `_btnEquip` `SetActive(true)` that the whole patch exists to make reachable.
 *
 * All four new sites reuse the *existing* [BOOL_TRUE_W] constant rather than getting a
 * purpose-named alias: the encoding is byte-identical, and a second constant with the same value
 * would be a maintenance trap (two names for one encoding that could drift apart on the next
 * edit). Sites 11–14 add **no new stub constant** at all.
 *
 * Branch-forcing edits (sites 7–9) — 4 bytes each, again **no `ret`** (same reasoning: these
 * are mid-function):
 *  - site 7 `b #0x28` → `0A 00 00 14` (0x1400000A): always take the "keep the slot" branch.
 *  - sites 8/9 `nop` → `1F 20 03 D5` (0xD503201F): always fall through to the happy path.
 *
 * Encodings cross-validated against the library itself rather than hand-assembled, counted
 * over the full 85,048,024 bytes:
 *
 *  | byte string | meaning | occurrences | used by |
 *  |---|---|---|---|
 *  | `20008052C0035FD6` | `mov w0,#1 ; ret` | **1,735** | sites 1–3, 6 |
 *  | `20008052`         | `mov w0,#1`       | **9,104** | sites 4–5, 11–14 |
 *  | `C0035FD6`         | `ret` alone       | 196,005 | — |
 *  | `00008052C0035FD6` | `mov w0,#0 ; ret` | 0       | site 10 |
 *  | `0A000014`         | `b #+0x28`        | 4,297   | site 7 |
 *  | `1F2003D5`         | `nop`             | 3,664   | sites 8–9 |
 *
 * All six rows were re-counted in this pass (whole-file byte search). The 1,735 figure matches
 * the number cited in ../unlock/UnlimitedCurrencyPatch.kt and ../ads/InstantRewardedVideoPatch.kt,
 * which independently cross-validates the 8-byte stub as one the IL2CPP compiler itself emits.
 * The 4-byte `mov w0,#1` is likewise the compiler's own constant-true form — which is why site 5's
 * neighbourhood already contains one.
 *
 * ⚠️ The three branch-forcing encodings were additionally checked the other way round — against
 * the assembler rather than against the library — with
 * `llvm-mc --triple=aarch64-linux-android -show-encoding`, because site 7 replaces a `tbnz` and
 * sites 8–9 replace `tbz`, and getting the polarity backwards would invert the intended fix:
 *
 * ```
 *  tbnz w0, #0, #40   => [0x40,0x01,0x00,0x37]   == site 7 ORIGINAL first 4 B  ✓
 *  b     #40          => [0x0a,0x00,0x00,0x14]   == site 7 REPLACEMENT          ✓
 *  tbz   w0, #0, #40  => [0x40,0x01,0x00,0x36]   == sites 8/9 ORIGINAL pattern   ✓
 *  nop                => [0x1f,0x20,0x03,0xd5]   == sites 8/9 REPLACEMENT        ✓
 *  mov  w0, #0        => [0x00,0x00,0x80,0x52]   == site 10 REPLACEMENT         ✓
 * ```
 *
 * (Note the `tbnz`/`tbz` distinction: site 7's original really is `tbnz` — 0x…37, not 0x…36 —
 * and the two encode to byte sequences differing only in the last byte. That is precisely why
 * site 7's 36-byte window, not its 4-byte prefix, is what identifies the instruction.)
 *
 * Frequency figures for the stub *patterns* are also in
 * `analysis/dead-target/notes/cosmetic-unlock-targets.md` §3.E; the replacement obviously
 * cannot be uniquely anchored (it is a common sequence) and does not need to be — uniqueness
 * is required of the **original anchor only**.
 *
 * Overwriting a prologue at sites 1–3, 6, 10 is safe: the stub returns immediately and **never
 * touches the stack**, so the discarded `stp x21,x20,[sp,#-32]!` / `stp x20,x19,[sp,#16]`
 * frame is simply never executed — no unbalanced sp, no callee-saved register clobber, no
 * leak. The `x1`/`w1` argument is ignored, which is exactly the point of a constant `true`
 * (site 10 a constant `false`). Sites 4–5, 7–9 and 11–14 discard no prologue at all; see SITES 4
 * AND 5, SITES 6 TO 10 and SITES 11 TO 14.

 * Every 36-byte window is exactly **1 occurrence**, and in all fourteen cases that single hit is
 * the documented file offset (i.e. `hit == VA − 0x4000`) — re-verified against the shipped
 * library for all fourteen rows above, in this pass, independently of the hunt note: whole-file
 * non-overlapping `find` scans at every prefix length 8…36, plus `bytes.count` cross-checks on the
 * ambiguous prefixes. The four new rows are **min-unique already at 8 bytes**, same as sites 4,
 * 5, 7, 8 and 9 — but 36 bytes is still searched and verified, because a mid-function window
 * starting at a non-entry proves nothing about *which* instruction it is until the surrounding
 * collection load, id load and consumer are included. The minimum-unique figure is a floor, not
 * a licence to shorten.
 *
 *  - Site 1 needs 16 bytes; 36 is used anyway, matching the sibling patches and giving margin
 *    against a future build shifting surrounding code.
 *  - Site 2 **must not** use a 16- or 20-byte anchor: both are ambiguous (2 hits — the other
 *    is `DSystem.GetSkinIndex(string,string)`). 24 bytes is the minimum; 36 is used.
 *  - Sites 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 14 are unique even at 4 bytes (their instruction
 *    encodings each occur
 *    once in 85 MB), but that is irrelevant: **all 36 bytes are still searched and verified**,
 *    because these windows start at a non-entry point and a 4-byte match would prove nothing
 *    about *which* instruction it was. The 36-byte window pins the collection load, the id load
 *    and the consumer. Only the first 4 are ever written.
 *  - Sites 6 and 10 share sites 1/3's word 0 (`stp x30,x21,[sp,#-0x20]!`, 24,734 hits at 8 B),
 *    so they need 12 bytes, exactly as sites 1 and 3 do. Site 6's discriminator is the
 *    `mov w19,w1`/`mov x20,x0` pair at +0x10/+0x14 followed by `adrp`-into-the-shared-generic
 *    body; site 10's is the same pair at +0x18/+0x1C followed by the `mvn`/`and` inversion tail.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Discrepancy found while re-verifying site 9, recorded so it is not re-litigated:**
 * `analysis/dead-target/notes/gun-usable-gate.md` §5 (G4) states that site 9's 8-byte prefix
 * occurs **12** times and that 12–28 bytes are ambiguous, with **32 bytes** the minimum unique
 * length. That row is **not reproducible**: all three counting methods above find **exactly one**
 * occurrence at *every* length from 8 B up, and that single hit is at the documented offset
 * `0x021CF0E4`. The note's conclusion (use the long window) is therefore kept — 36 bytes is
 * used for site 9 like every other site — but its *reason* was wrong, and the ambiguity it
 * warns about does not exist. Recorded rather than silently "fixed", because if a future build
 * really does make that prefix ambiguous the guard machinery below would reject it loudly rather
 * than write into the wrong place.
 *
 * Only the first 8 bytes (sites 1–3, 6, 10) or first 4 bytes (sites 4–5, 7–9, 11–14) are ever
 * written,
 * and each
 * write is same-length, so the remaining 32 / 32 anchor bytes are pure verification. Every
 * write is additionally guarded by read-original-bytes-then-compare (see [applyItemAnchors]) and
 * by the "exactly one occurrence" check, so a new game build fails loudly with a
 * [PatchException] instead of writing into the wrong function.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * NO OVERLAP WITH THE OTHER DEAD TARGET PATCHES
 * ============================================================================
 * **20 write windows** are live across the Dead Target patch set as it now stands (the god-mode
 * patch is **not** part of the shipped set — see the note below):
 *  - 5 × 12-byte currency getters — ../unlock/UnlimitedCurrencyPatch.kt: `0x218BD78`,
 *    `0x2192464`, `0x21925DC`, `0x2193234`, `0x2194A2C`
 *  - 1 × 12-byte ads window — ../ads/InstantRewardedVideoPatch.kt: `0x283BDE0`
 *  - this file's fourteen (8+8+8+4+4+8+4+4+4+8+4+4+4+4 = **76 bytes across 14 windows**)
 *
 * (The hunt note's overlap test additionally includes the 8 god-mode windows
 * `0x2142988`, `0x214299C`, `0x21429B4`, `0x21F4AA4`, `0x21F4FFC`, `0x21F52F0`, `0x22B4FB0`,
 * `0x22B4FC8` that were recorded in `gun-usable-gate.md` §5, for margin. They change nothing —
 * the nearest of them to any site here is `0x22B4FC8`, **2.2 MB** from site 12 — and the god-mode
 * patch is not currently in the set, so they are listed as margin rather than counted.)
 *
 * The interval-overlap test `aStart < bEnd && bStart < aEnd` was re-run over **all
 * C(20,2) = 190** pairs, on **both** axes — once with the *write* lengths (4/8/12 B) and once
 * with the full *anchor* lengths (36 B, or the write length where there is no anchor) — because
 * two patches can be disjoint where they write yet still collide where they *verify*. Both runs
 * return **zero overlaps: all 20 windows pairwise disjoint**, twice.
 *
 * Nearest neighbour per window added in this pass (the four glove/drone equip gates):
 *
 *  | new window | write | nearest window | byte distance |
 *  |---|---|---|---|
 *  |11 `0x02BBBE3C` | 4 B | site 14 `0x02BB8E20` | 12,312 B (12.0 KB) |
 *  |12 `0x0240A064` | 4 B | site 4 `0x02631630` | 2,258,376 B (2205.4 KB) |
 *  |13 `0x02BB8CE0` | 4 B | site 14 `0x02BB8E20` | **316 B (0.3 KB)** |
 *  |14 `0x02BB8E20` | 4 B | site 13 `0x02BB8CE0` | **316 B (0.3 KB)** |
 *
 * Sites 13 and 14 sit 0x140 apart inside `DroneShopView`, so **316 B** is the tightest new
 * separation and it is inherent to where the gates are, not a hazard: 316 B is ~8.8× the 36-byte
 * anchor and ~79× the 4-byte write, so no anchor search can reach into the neighbouring window.
 * Measured on the anchor axis the gap is 284 B (still ~7.9× the window). Every other new site is
 * **12 KB or further** from its nearest neighbour, and site 12 — 2.2 MB from anything else —
 * could not interact with any write in this patch set under any interpretation.
 *
* Nearest neighbour per window added in this pass (the five gun-usability gates):
*
*  | new window | write | nearest window | byte distance |
*  |---|---|---|---|
*  | 6 `0x020A4708` | 8 B | site 10 `0x020679A8` | 249,176 B (243.3 KB) |
*  | 7 `0x021CE90C` | 4 B | site 8 `0x021CEDB0` | **1,184 B (1.2 KB)** |
*  | 8 `0x021CEDB0` | 4 B | site 9 `0x021CF0E4` | **816 B (0.8 KB)** |
*  | 9 `0x021CF0E4` | 4 B | site 8 `0x021CEDB0` | **816 B (0.8 KB)** |
*  |10 `0x020679A8` | 8 B | site 6 `0x020A4708` | 249,176 B (243.3 KB) |
*
 * The tightest separations in the *gun* gates are sites 8↔9 at **816 B** (~200× the 4-byte write)
 * — those gates live in three adjacent `DSystem` methods (`FixedWrongEquipWeapon`,
 * `GetOwnedGunConfigById`, `GetCurEquipedGunBattle` are consecutive methods at `0x021D26C0`,
 * `0x021D2D38`, `0x021D2E9C`), which is inherent to where the gates are, not a hazard: 816 B is
 * ~17× the 36-byte anchor and ~200× the write, so no anchor search can reach into a neighbouring
 * window. Their nearest *pre-existing* neighbour is site 3 (`CheckHaveGun`, `0x021D1BB4`) at
 * 10,956 B.
 *
 * (Historic note: when this file had 5 sites, the tightest pair was 22.2 KB, site 3 ↔ site 1.
 * Both later waves are *closer* to their own new neighbours than that — 816 B for the gun gates,
 * 316 B for the new glove/drone gates — which is why those figures are quoted rather than the old
 * 22.2 KB one. Both are still ≥7× the anchor length.)
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * BATTLE-PASS CONSEQUENCE — site 3 lands on the other leg of site 1's AND
 * ============================================================================
 * `ConfigLazyEvent4BattlePassRecord.GetBattlePassRewardId(int rewardId, bool isFreePass,
 * out bool isCompensation)` at VA `0x023C43D4` gates gun-skin battle-pass rewards on
 * `SkinData.IsEnable(skinIndex) && DSystem.IsGunUnlock(gunId)`:
 *
 * ```
 *   23c45e0: bl    0x24b1a44               <- SkinData.IsEnable(skinIndex)
 *   23c45e4: tbz   w0, #0x0, 0x23c46f8     <- if NOT owned -> keep original rewardId
 *   23c45fc: bl    0x21db470               <- DSystem.IsGunUnlock(gunId)   <-- site 1 (shipped)
 *   23c4600: tbz   w0, #0x0, 0x23c46f8     <- if NOT gun-unlocked -> keep original rewardId
 * ```
 *
 * (Both branch targets re-decoded from the library bytes and confirmed.) Because `IsEnable`
 * reduces to `CheckHaveGun(gunId)` — literally the same predicate as `IsGunUnlock` at a
 * different entry — **both legs of the AND are the same predicate.** Site 1 already forced
 * the second leg; **site 3 completes the first.** So this is *not* a new class of side effect:
 * it is the already-documented site-1 behaviour arriving through the skin leg instead of the
 * gun leg.
 *
 * Quantified increment: battle-pass gun-skin rewards whose `IsEnable` currently returns false
 * now take the "owned/claimed" branch. `IsEnable` already returns `true` when the gun config
 * cannot be resolved (`0x024B1D60: mov w0,#1`), so the affected set is exactly the rewards
 * whose gun is present in config **and** absent from `inventory`.
 *
 * What the "owned" branch does: it tests `List<int>.Contains` over `UserData.claimFreePass`
 * (0x600) or `UserData.claimBattlePass` (0x608), selected by `isFreePass`; if the reward has
 * already been claimed it **appends the skin picName** to `UserData.skinClaimInEvent`
 * (`List<string>.Add` at VA `0x023C46F0`) and then returns **reward id 23 with
 * `isCompensation = true`** instead of the real reward — verified at `0x023C4714`:
 * `mov w8,#1 ; mov w0,#0x17 (23) ; strb w8,[x19]`. The visible effect is that some
 * battle-pass gun-skin reward slots may show as compensation/claimed rather than offering the
 * skin. Nothing crashes and no currency is granted by this patch. The one write on this path
 * is a `List<string>.Add` of a string the caller already holds, so it cannot shift another
 * list's indices and cannot throw. Called out plainly rather than hidden.
 *
* `UnlockSkinAfterBuyPack` (VA `0x0204F534`) and `UserData.IsBattlePassNewPackAvailable`
* (TypeDefIndex 3770) call none of these ten sites and are unaffected.
*
 * ============================================================================
 * REMOVAL / CONSUMPTION GUARDS — none of the fourteen sites has one
 * ============================================================================
 *  | Site | Any caller that removes or consumes? | Verdict |
 *  |---|---|---|
 *  | 1 `IsGunUnlock` | 1 of 5 (`RemoveGun`, guarded `Dictionary.Remove` on an absent key = no-op) | safe |
 *  | 2 `IsOwnGlove(string)` | No. 12 callers, all reads/filters. | safe |
 *  | 3 `CheckHaveGun` | No. 32 callers, all reads/filters. | safe |
 *  | 4 drone inline `ContainsKey` | No. Single consumer is `_iconOwned.SetActive`. | safe |
 *  | 5 glove inline `List.Contains` | No. Single consumer is `_iconOwned.SetActive`. | safe |
 *  | 6 `WeaponShopView.IsOwnedItem` | No. 9 callers, all button/layout wiring + price display. | safe |
 *  | 7 `FixedWrongEquipWeapon` branch | **Supplies** the write this patch skips (`equipedItems[slot]` = fallback id); removing that branch removes a write, adds none. | safe |
 *  | 8 `GetOwnedGunConfigById` branch | No. Pure return-value producer; sole caller is `GetCurEquipedGun`. | safe |
 *  | 9 `GetCurEquipedGunBattle` branch | No. Pure return-value producer. | safe |
 *  |10 `CheckItemLocked` | No. 3 callers, raid-boss lock icons/taps only. | safe |
 *  |11 glove shop inline `Contains` | No. Consumer is button `SetActive` / `set_interactable` / caption. The `Btn_Del_Cheat` / `Btn_Get_Cheat` rows it also flips are ANDed with the `DSystem+0x5DA` dev flag and stay hidden. | safe |
 *  |12 glove battle inline `Contains` | No. Identical shape to 11 in the NGUI selector. | safe |
 *  |13 drone `SetupButtonEquip` | No. Method is 0x124 B and has exactly two effects: `_btnEquip.SetActive` and a caption. | safe |
 *  |14 drone `SetupButtonUnlock` | No. Label text only. | safe |
*
* Every patched value is consumed either by `SetActive(bool)` or by a boolean branch, and the
* underlying collections are never written, so no patched site can shift a collection index or
* throw. Site 7 is the one case where the patched instruction used to *lead to* a write — and
* that write is precisely the bug being fixed. This is also why the *other* candidates below
* were rejected: they DO guard destructive operations.
*
* **Side effect of site 6 worth stating:** with the shop's only ownership predicate forced
* true, the shop stops quoting *purchase* prices for un-owned guns and starts quoting *upgrade*
* prices (`GetCurPrice` / `GetCurTypePrice` are two of its nine callers), and `_lbGunLocked`
* plus the buy/upgrade button row resolve to the owned layout. That is self-consistent with
* "you own it" and matches the effect site 1 already had on sale/offer surfaces, but it is a
* visible change in the shop and is called out rather than hidden.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * VERIFIED DEAD ENDS AND REJECTED TARGETS — do not retry any of these
 * ============================================================================
* **`DSystem.IsGunUnlockV2(ItemConfig)` — DEAD END.** VA `0x021DBD4C` / file `0x021D7D4C`.
* The shipped game already contains the stub: the bytes at that offset are
* `20 00 80 52 C0 03 5F D6`, byte-identical to the replacement this patch writes. The devs
* shipped it as a hardcoded `return true`. Writing the same 8 bytes is a **pure no-op**.
* Recorded so nobody retries it. Its 36-byte anchor
* (`20008052C0035FD6FFC301D1FE5F04A9F65705A9F44F06A9757A01B0A83A5039F403012A`) is still
* unique, so if a future build ever puts a real body there, re-evaluate — not before.
* (Confirmed again in the gun-usability pass: it is a display-only `always true` like site 1 and
* adds nothing on the equip path either.)
*
* **`DSystem.get_IsMeleeModeUnlock()` — DEAD END, another dev-shipped stub.** VA `0x0218F754` /
* file `0x0218B754`. Its body is `mov w0,wzr ; ret` — a hardcoded **`return false`**, shipped by
* the devs, exactly like `IsGunUnlockV2` above. So melee mode is *off* in this build, which means
* "the gun is gated out of melee mode" **cannot** be the equip bug, and there is nothing to patch
* here: writing the same two instructions back is a no-op. Recorded so nobody spends a pass on a
* melee-mode gun gate.
*
* **`DSystem.EnableGod` (0xB23) / `DSystem.EnablePhoenix` (0xB22) — DEAD ENDS, and not god mode.**
* These are `DSystem` cheat *flags*, and two independent findings kill them here:
*  1. **Not god mode.** All 9 read sites are `UpgradeWeaponRecord` skill-rate getters
*     (`GodRate` → `1.0f`, `GodDelayMin` → `9.0f`, `PhoenixRate`, `PhoenixDamageRate`,
*     `PhoenixTime`, `PhoenixDelay`) — an *offence-bonus cheat for the God/Hades/Zeus gun skins*,
*     additionally gated on `isUseCheat`. There is no "player takes no damage" consumer
*     anywhere, despite the name.
*  2. **Zero writers.** Nothing in the shipped build ever stores `true` into either field (an
*     exhaustive `str`/`strb` scan finds none), so even setting them would only work until
*     something else clears them — and nothing does, which is why the flag cannot self-reset.
* Both facts are established in `analysis/dead-target/notes/godmode-cheat-targets.md` §3 and
* repeated in ./cheat/GodModeCheatMenuPatch.kt. Re-confirmed in this pass: the field is read as
* `ldrb w8,[x0,#0xb23]` / `#0xb22` and the corresponding `cbnz` targets are the rate getters.
* Not touched by this patch.
*
* **`SkinData.isOwnSkin(int skinidx)` — DEAD CODE.** VA `0x024B279C` / file `0x024AE79C`. The
* bytes are a perfect little leaf predicate (`PartInfo.ContainsKey`), and the exhaustive
* BL-target scan of the whole executable LOAD segment finds **0 call sites**. Patching it
* would change nothing. (Re-confirmed in this pass: the scan used for the gun-usability work
* still reports 0 callers for this target.)
 *
 * **`DSystem.IsOwnSkin(int skinId)` — REJECTED: real bytes, WRONG gate.** VA `0x021DB2D4` /
 * file `0x021D72D4`. Genuine prologue, unique 36-byte anchor — and only **3** BL callers, all
 * legacy-collection code: `LegacyCollectionManager.ClaimUnclaimedRewards()` (branch VA
 * `0x023CEFA4`), `LegacyCollectionManager.ClaimReward(...)` (`0x023D01BC`) and
 * `PopupLegacyCollection.InitItems(List<int>)`. **Zero** shop or inventory callers. It is also
 * a *dispatcher*, not a leaf: it reads a type word at `+0x14`, compares against `0x64`/`0xC8`/
 * `0x12C` (100/200/300), tail-branches to `IsOwnGlove(int)` for 300 and to
 * `isOwnedGunSkin(int,int)` for 100/200, and returns `false` otherwise — so it does not even
 * cover every skin type. Patching it would achieve nothing in the skin shop while corrupting
 * two reward-claim guards.
 *
 * **`DSystem.IsOwnedDrone()` — REJECTED: WRONG semantics.** VA `0x021DA490` / file
 * `0x021D6490`. Verified real, but the dump.cs signature is `public bool IsOwnedDrone() { }`
 * — **no parameter**. Its body is `droneInventory.Count > 0`, i.e. "do you own *any* drone",
 * so forcing it true unlocks **zero** individual drones. Worse, one of its only two callers is
 * `DroneManager.DropItem()` — a loot-drop function — so it would make the drone drop-item
 * generator believe a drone is always owned: a gameplay/economy change, not a cosmetic unlock.
 * Site 4 is the correct drone site.
 *
 * **`DSystem.IsOwnGlove(int gloveid)` — REJECTED.** VA `0x021DB268` / file `0x021D7268`.
 * Only **2** callers, both inside `ConfigFrankExclusiveReward.GetRewardByGun(string)`
 * (branch VAs `0x023C3A3C`, `0x023C3CF4`) — a Frank-event helper, not the glove shop.
 * `IsOwnGlove(string)` (site 2) is the one the shop uses.
 *
 * **`isOwnedGunSkin(string,int)` / `isOwnedGunSkin(int,int)` — REJECTED.** VA `0x021D5C14` /
 * `0x021C7668`. The first is the guard inside `DSystem.DeleteSkin(string,int)` (branch VA
 * `0x021D94FC`) and `DSystem.GetGunTokenSkin(bool)` (`0x021C6E38`), i.e. it authorises
 * **deleting** skins and **consuming** a gun-token skin the player does not hold. The second
 * has only 6 callers, all legacy-collection / medal code, no shop.
 *
 * **`SkinData.IsEnable(int skinIndex)` — REJECTED as too broad.** VA `0x024B1A44`. It is the
 * correct predicate (site 3's proof chain), but **53** callers including
 * `UserData.ToThisByBinaryData` (save deserialisation), the gacha reward pickers,
 * `DialogLoginReward.BtnOKClick`, `HalloweenEvent.*` and `MiniEventBoxController.IsDupData`.
 * Site 3 reaches the same result through a 32-caller, read-only, DSystem-level entry point.
 *
 * **`get_IsDroneUnlocked()`** (VA `0x0218F7A4`) and **`LazyEventController.IsOwnedItem(int)`**
 * (VA `0x0239F95C`) — verified real and unique, but the first is a *feature* gate ("is the
 * drone feature unlocked at all", 2 callers in `ControlMapView.CheckActiveTutorialInWorldMap`),
 * the second an *event-reward* filter. Neither unlocks individual items. Excluded.
 *
 * **`ConfigLazyEvent4BattlePassRecord.IsGunSkinAndUserOwned(int,bool)`** (VA `0x023C4970`) —
 * verified real but its minimum unique prefix is **24 bytes**, not 12, and forcing it true is
 * a battle-pass *change* rather than a cosmetic unlock. Excluded.
 *
* **The shared generic collection helpers** `Dictionary<int,int>.ContainsKey` @ `0x036C6420`,
* `List<int>.Contains` @ `0x03BE9A04`, `Dictionary<string,SkinData>.ContainsKey` @ `0x03757558`
* — hundreds of callers each across the whole engine (config tables, `FileBrowser`, `TreeView`,
* `TMP_FontUtilities`, …). Never patch these. Sites 4 and 5 exist precisely *because* they
* must not be, and sites 6–10 for the same reason: five of them are the *call sites* of this very
* shared generic (`WeaponShopView.IsOwnedItem` tail-branches to `0x36C6420`, and so do the
* `ContainsKey` calls inside `FixedWrongEquipWeapon`, `GetOwnedGunConfigById` and
* `GetCurEquipedGunBattle`). Patching the callee would rewrite the engine; patching the
* *narrower* caller is what sites 6–10 do.
*
 * **`DSystem.EquipedItems(int,int)` / `EquipGun(UpgradeWeaponRecord)` / `SwitchItemsEquiped()` /
 * `CheckEquipIfNeed(int)` — REJECTED: NO GATE.** The whole equip *commit* chain was disassembled
 * and contains **zero** ownership reads: `WeaponShopView.ChangeEquipment` → `EquipedItems` /
 * `SwitchItemsEquiped` → `EquipGun` writes `equipedItems[slot] = gunId` unconditionally. This is
 * the good news half of the gun-usability finding — you *can* commit an equip for any id — and it
 * is also why the fix is sites 7–9 (stop the repair, stop the null record) rather than a patch on
 * the commit itself.
 *
 * **The same "no gate on the commit" finding applies to gloves and drones**, which is why sites
 * 11–14 stop at the button rather than going further. `GlovesView.BtnUse_OnClick`
 * (`0x02BC030C`) and `ControlGloveSkin.BtnUse_OnClick` (`0x0240E494`) are each a bare
 * `str w8,[x9,#0x490]`; `DroneShopView.EquipClick` (`0x02BBD1F4`) tail-calls
 * `DSystem.EquipedDrone(int)` (`0x021D5E38`), which is `ldr x8,[x0,#0x1A0]` /
 * `str w1,[x8,#0x118]`. All unconditional, no ownership read. **Do not look for a commit-path
 * gate; there is none to patch.**
 *
 * **A null-returning record resolver for gloves/drones — RULED OUT, checked, do not retry.**
 * This was failure shape (b) for guns (`GetOwnedGunConfigById` / `GetCurEquipedGunBattle`
 * returning `null` → `GunController.Init` `cbz x0` → `il2cpp_null_reference_throw`), so it was
 * actively looked for and is **absent** for both categories:
 *  - **Gloves resolve from the raw int.** `UpgradeWeaponRecord.CurrentGloveRecord(ref int handid)`
 *    (`0x02A0BF30`) reads `UserData.curHandSkin` (`0x490`), stores it to `*handid`, and rejects
 *    only `curHandSkin < 1` (`0x02A0BF9C b.lt`) before a config-table lookup. **Zero
 *    `listHandSkin` access in the entire body.** `GunController.FindGloveAndSkin` (`0x021042CC`)
 *    is the same (`0x02104384 str w8,[x19,#0x0]`), as are all 132 chained `[userData+0x490]`
 *    read sites. `BtnUse_OnClick` writes any real glove id, so the guard is always satisfied.
 *    The vestigial `DSystem.GetHandGlove()` (`0x021DB1E4`), which returns `listHandSkin[0]` and
 *    *would* be an ownership read, has **0 branch callers and 0 `adrp` page references**, and
 *    `listHandSkin` is append-only (the sole genuine writer is the dev cheat
 *    `UnlockGloveById`) — so it can never mean "currently equipped". The live field is
 *    `curHandSkin`.
 *  - **Drones resolve via a lookup that is already safe.** `DroneManager.SpawnDrone`
 *    (`0x02255214`) reads `equippedDrone` straight through to `DownloadDrone` with no membership
 *    test (`0x02255310 ldr w1,[x8,#0x118]`). The level lookup it uses,
 *    `DUtil.GetLevelDrone(int)` (`0x028DDF60`), is the exact structural twin of the
 *    `DUtil.GetLevelItem` that made gun gates G3/G4 safe: on the not-owned path it returns a
 *    **static default level** (`0x028DE040 ldr x8,[x0,#0xB8]` / `0x028DE048 ldr w0,[x8,#0x20]`)
 *    — it does not throw and does not return `null`. So forcing ownership yields a
 *    *well-formed* level-1-equivalent drone with no further patch, and there is no null record to
 *    protect in the first place.
 *
 * **A repair / revert pass over the glove/drone selection — RULED OUT, checked, do not retry.**
 * This was failure shape (c) for guns (`FixedWrongEquipWeapon` running on every
 * `SetupEquipment`). `DSystem.SetupEquipment()` (`0x021D25B0`) calls `FixedWrongEquipWeapon` at
 * `0x021D262C` and then touches **no** glove or drone state before returning at `0x021D26BC`.
 * The only two routines that clear `curHandSkin` / `equippedDrone` are a matched save/restore
 * pair — `SetEquipmentToDedault()` (`0x021F0B00`, saves both to `this+0xA2C` / `+0xA30` then sets
 * `equippedDrone = -1`, `curHandSkin = 0`) and `ResetEquipment()` (`0x021F0B34`, which restores
 * both) — and an exhaustive BL scan finds exactly **six** callers: `BaseDefenseController
 * .<PlayMission>b__1`, `CrossbowPvpHistoryView.StartGame` (both call the setter) and
 * `CrossbowPVPController.ResetBattleData`, `PauseGameUI.Exit`, `BattleResultView.ShowMainResult`
 * (all three call the restorer). All six are **crossbow-PVP / base-defence mode** scoped — the
 * game's "strip your loadout for this mode" mechanic, which restores on exit. Not on the glove or
 * drone path in normal play.
 *
 * **A level override — REJECTED ON EVIDENCE, and there is nothing to override.** Neither
 * `HandSkinRecord` (28 fields) nor `DroneConfig` (18 fields) has any level field, and
 * `unlockLevel|minLevel|requireLevel|levelLimit|openLevel|levelUnlock|needLevel|maxLevel` does not
 * exist for these types anywhere in `dump.cs` (the only `levelUnlock` is `GunInfos`, i.e. gun
 * skins; the `maxLevel` hits are card/rarity records). A global `DSystem.get_level()` override was
 * nevertheless measured: **98 direct branch sites** feeding XP curves, missions and rank, and zero
 * gain. Full reasoning in THE LEVEL-GATE QUESTION above. **There is no level gate on gloves or
 * drones.**
 *
 * **A fifth "Btn_Use interactable" gate — DOES NOT EXIST; do not re-derive it from a bad
 * disassembly.** The `cset w1, ne` at `0x02BBFEE0` / `0x0240E104` mis-renders as
 * `csinc w1, wzr, wzr, eq` under `llvm-objdump -M no-aliases`, which reads as an inverted
 * condition and suggests a fifth gate. It is `ne`. See DISASSEMBLY TRAP above for the bit-exact
 * decode, the `llvm-mc` round trip and the library cross-check.
 *
 * **`DSystem.HaveEquipGun(int)` — REJECTED: wrong data.** VA `0x021D61C4` / file `0x021D21C4`.
* Reads `UserData.equipedItems` (0x110), i.e. "is equipped", not "is owned".
* `DSystem.OnwedGunValueThan(int)`, `IsGunHavePromoteSystem(int)`,
* `UnlockPromoteSystemByGunOwned()`, `IfChallengeModeAvailableAllGun/ByEquipGun` — rejected:
* gun *value* comparison and challenge-mode power flags, not ownership.
* `BattlePreparationView.HaveEnoughPowerForBattle` (VA `0x02B98044`) — rejected: a power check
* that calls `DUtil.GetLevelItem`, which is safe for un-owned ids (see site 8/9 above).
*
* ============================================================================
* HONEST SCOPE — this is a READ patch, and here is exactly what that means
* ============================================================================
 * All fourteen sites make ownership **reads** — or the branches that hang off them — answer
 * "owned". That is the whole mechanism, and it has a precise limit worth stating rather than
 * glossing — stated once here for the merged patch:
*
*  - **Nothing is added to any owned list.** No gun id is inserted into `UserData.inventory`
 *    (0xE8) or `gunList`, no glove id into `UserData.listHandSkin` (0x488), no drone id into
 *    `UserData.droneInventory` (0xF0), no skin part into `SkinData.PartInfo`.
 *  - **Therefore nothing is written to the save file / persistent profile.** Every item is
 *    unlocked *as far as the game's own code can observe it* — shop tiles, selectors,
 *    reward filters — while the underlying save data is untouched. A real purchase still
 *    persists normally; this patch neither duplicates nor suppresses that.
 *  - **Sites 4 and 5 change routing, not just icons.** `DroneItemCtrl.OnClick` has no
 *    ownership guard, so a drone tile that now renders as owned routes to the equip/select
 *    flow rather than the buy flow. Since the drone is genuinely absent from
 *    `droneInventory`, whatever consumes the equip request may find nothing to equip. UI
 *    state only — no id is added — but a real behavioural difference from the unpatched
 *    build, and not glossed over.
*  - **`SkinData.PartInfo` (individual skin parts / upgrade pieces) is untouched.** Gun-skin
*    ownership reduces to gun ownership, so tiles light up, but `AddPart` / `SetPart` /
*    `GetPart` progression is unaffected.
*  - **Drone *skins* ride along only indirectly.** Site 4 covers the `DroneItemCtrl` path;
*    other drone-skin surfaces were not enumerated exhaustively and may not be covered.
*  - **Nothing is written to the save file, and nothing persists.** Sites 6–10 make a gun
*    *usable in this session* — the shop wires the Equip/Upgrade button, the loadout repair
*    stops overwriting your slots, and the battle-prep record resolvers stop returning `null`.
*    But `inventory` still lacks the id, so every predicate this patch does not touch keeps
*    saying "not owned" (sale banners, offer suppression, `GunTrainManager` trial lists, quest /
*    medal `IsMatchCondition`, `ProgressRoadHelper`, `RecommendPackMng`, `EventGunTrial`,
*    `TreasureHuntingEventController.GetCurrentGunTier`, `TopupEventController`,
*    `BattlePass` reward choice, `ControlMap2D` / `ControlMapView` sale notices,
*    `MissionInfoView` recommend/buy), and a reinstall or save wipe resets everything.
*    **Only the devs' own cheat methods (below) actually persist an unlock.**
 *  - **Guns: device-verified.** The user confirmed guns load, equip and fire after sites 6–10
 *    landed, which is why the "expect at least one more `inventory` reader" warning written
 *    earlier in this file is retired: it did not materialise.
 *  - **Gloves and drones: the display-only failure was reported, the gates are now in, and this
 *    wave is still not device-tested.** The honest position, stated as evidence tiers:
 *      - **The diagnosis is strong, and stronger than "no gate found".** Sites 11–14 are gates
 *        that were *located*, not merely absent: the not-owned branch provably jumps past the
 *        only `Btn_Use.SetActive(true)` (site 11, confirmed by exhaustive `bl` scan of the method
 *        range), and site 13's `_btnEquip.SetActive(owned)` is the sole gate with no branch at
 *        all. This is "a second gate found", not "no second gate found".
 *      - **The remaining risk is the wiring, not the gate.** `GlovesView.BtnUse_OnClick`,
 *        `ControlGloveSkin.BtnUse_OnClick` and `DroneShopView.EquipClick` each have **0 `adrp`-based
 *        page references** in the `il2cpp` section, i.e. they are wired from the inspector via
 *        runtime metadata slots that are zero on disk. They were identified *by elimination* — each
 *        is the only method of its class that writes `curHandSkin` / `equippedDrone` — which is
 *        strong but not a resolved runtime slot. **If a button appears and pressing it does
 *        nothing, this wiring is the first thing to re-examine**, not sites 11–14.
 *      - **Sites 11 and 12 must ship together** (see SITES 11 TO 14): a half-fix here is
 *        indistinguishable from no fix on the battle screen.
 *      - **`DSystem+0x5DA`, the dev flag ANDed into `Btn_Del_Cheat` / `Btn_Get_Cheat`, was not
 *        identified.** It was not needed and not patched; sites 11/12 cannot by themselves expose
 *        those cheat buttons.
 *  - **Skins remain structurally the safest of the three and were not reported broken.** The
 *    apply path (`GunController.FindGloveAndSkin` → `GunSkinManager.GetCurSkinIndex`,
 *    VA `0x0288A04C`) queries `UserData+0x540` (`gunSkinData`) and never consults `inventory`;
 *    there is no `FixedWrongEquipWeapon` analogue and no null-record resolver for skins. Sites 8
 *    and 9 already cover the shared gun-record resolver, so skins ride along on the gun fix.
 *  - **Not covered, and not claimed to be:** `UnlockSkinAfterBuyPack`,
 *    `UserData.IsBattlePassNewPackAvailable`, and the battle-pass *reward selection* surfaces
 *    are affected only as described in BATTLE-PASS CONSEQUENCE, not unlocked.
 *  - **`GetLuckyExtraDamageRate` (`0x02253D30`) reads `droneInventory` and was deliberately NOT
 *    patched.** It feeds a drone combat *stat*, so forcing it true would be a balance change, not
 *    an equip fix. Named here so nobody "finishes the job" by writing it.

 *
 * If you want the ids genuinely *written* into the owned lists, see the upgrade path below.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * UPGRADE PATH — the devs' own cheat methods (real state writes, NOT implemented here)
 * ============================================================================
 * `DSystem` ships its own cheat routines, and these are the ones that make **real state
 * changes** — they append the ids to the owned lists, so the unlock *persists to the
 * save file*:
 *
 *    DSystem.UnlockAllGuns()       VA 0x021D9730   (private; just a loop calling UnlockItem)
 *    DSystem.UnlockAllGunSkins()   VA 0x021DA614
 *    DSystem.UnlockAllGloves()     VA 0x021DA988
 *    DSystem.UnlockDrone(int,bool) VA 0x021DA3C8
 *    DSystem.UnlockGloveById(int)  VA 0x021DABCC
 *    DSystem.UnlockGunSkinOnly     VA 0x021D9F50
 *    DSystem.UnlockDroneSkinOnly   VA 0x021DA1B0
 *    DSystem.UnlockItem(int)       VA 0x021D9414   (the per-gun write the loop calls)
 *    DSystem.UnlockGunByIAPOK(int,string) VA 0x021D9080  (the devs' own IAP-bypass unlock)
 *    DSystem.AutoUnlockInventory() VA 0x0219E84C   (private)
 *
* These are all ordinary managed methods with no bytecode body you can flatten to a constant
* — they are *runtime invocations*. Making them fire needs an `il2cpp_class_from_name` +
* `il2cpp_runtime_invoke` call from a **runtime companion ARM64 `.so`** loaded after the
* Unity/Il2Cpp domain is up (the ubisoftpop route: `JNI_OnLoad` → poll
* `il2cpp_domain_get` → `il2cpp_thread_attach` → resolve → invoke). That is the real
* unlock-with-persistence, and it is **deliberately not implemented here** — it needs an NDK
* toolchain and a second bytecode half to trigger `System.loadLibrary`, versus the
* same-length static byte edits used above.
*
* Worth being explicit about the relationship between the two routes: **the cheat methods are
* the only way to make an unlock persist**, and invoking them would make sites 6–10 largely
* redundant (a real state write fixes every `inventory` reader at once, including the ~98 direct
* readers). They are kept separate here because the reported bug — guns owned but unusable — is
* fully fixable with static bytes, and the `.so` route is ~10× the work for an equivalent result
* *for this symptom*. If a future goal is persistence rather than usability, do the `.so`.
*
* Trade-off, stated plainly: this patch is a static edit that needs no NDK and survives the
* whole VNG re-sign flow, at the cost of not writing the save file. The dev cheats persist,
* at the cost of a companion `.so`. Choose deliberately, not by accident.
*
* ============================================================================
* SCOPE — deliberately narrow: ownership READS and the branches on them, nothing else
* ============================================================================
* * No `AdsCallbacks` / `MediationManager` / `AdsController` method — ads live in
*   ../ads/InstantRewardedVideoPatch.kt.
* * No currency getter — currency lives in ../unlock/UnlimitedCurrencyPatch.kt.
* * No god-mode field (`DSystem.EnableGod`, `0xB23`), no `EnablePhoenix` (`0xB22`) and no
*   `showcheat` UI flag — and note those two flags are not god mode anyway and have no writer;
*   see VERIFIED DEAD ENDS.
* * No `armeabi-v7a` branch: this XAPK ships **arm64-v8a ONLY** (splits: base +
*   `UnityDataAssetPack.apk` + `config.arm64_v8a.apk`), so a second anchor table would be
*   dead code.
* * Every rejected candidate in VERIFIED DEAD ENDS AND REJECTED TARGETS stays rejected.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * DELIVERY — how the patched .so lands in the XAPK split pipeline
 * ============================================================================
 * Same shape as both sibling Dead Target patches, which shipped and device-verified on this
 * same XAPK (see their DELIVERY sections, and Dead Trigger's NativeIapVerifierBypass KDoc
 * for the full Javap read-writeup of the classes involved): `PatchEngine` runs
 * `ApkMerger.merge()` FIRST, so base + `UnityDataAssetPack.apk` + `config.arm64_v8a.apk`
 * become ONE merged APK before any patch executes; the config split is what carries
 * `lib/arm64-v8a/libil2cpp.so`. A `rawResourcePatch` anywhere in the patch set forces
 * `ResourceMode.RAW_ONLY`, so `get(path, true)` resolves the raw-extracted
 * `lib/<abi>/libil2cpp.so`. **All fourteen writes are SAME-LENGTH in place** — 8-over-8 at sites
 * 1–3, 6 and 10, 4-over-4 at sites 4–5, 7–9 and 11–14, **76 bytes total** — so
 * `detectFileChanges()` catches each on
 * `lastModified` → `ApkUtils.applyTo` overlays them into the rebuilt APK →
 * `signWithLegacyFallback`. Only the first 8 (resp. 4) bytes of each 36-byte anchor are written;
 * the other 28/32 are verified and left alone, so the file length never changes and no `lib/`
 * entry is re-added.
 *
 * Static file patch (chosen) vs runtime companion `.so`: the `.text` is plaintext on disk,
 * there is NO `.so` integrity / signature / anti-tamper check anywhere in the chain
 * (protection-bypass.md: no pairip, no Java signature verification, and VNG
 * `libpglarmor.so` is not even Java-loaded), and the whole bundle is re-signed as one unit —
 * so a static byte edit needs no NDK, no companion `.so`, no `System.loadLibrary` trigger
 * and no `mprotect` dance. It also sidesteps the ubisoftpop packed-lib timing lesson
 * outright: nothing is touched at runtime, before or after Unity's native init.
 *
 * Discovery: a top-level `val … = rawResourcePatch(…)` IS a public static field of type
 * Patch, which is exactly what `PatchLoader` scans (see the DISCOVERY notes in
 * ../../../deadtrigger/patches/il2cpp/NativeIapVerifierBypass.kt's KDoc). One concern →
 * plain top-level `val`, **no** `dependsOn`. list-patches therefore shows exactly one
 * "All items owned" entry per Dead Target patch set.

 * One guarded byte-range replacement in `libil2cpp.so`.
 *
 * [anchorHex] is the ORIGINAL 36-byte window (must occur exactly ONCE in the library — that
 * uniqueness is what makes the match self-verifying); [replacementHex] is the replacement
 * written over the first bytes of that window — **8 bytes** at the six function-entry sites,
 * **4 bytes** at the nine mid-function sites. The two lengths are independent axes on purpose:
 * nine of the fourteen sites carry a 36-byte verification window with only 4 bytes written.
 *
 * Named `ItemAnchor`, not `Anchor`, and that is the ONLY deviation from the sibling patches'
 * structure: this file shares package `app.deadtarget.patches.unlock` with
 * ../unlock/UnlimitedCurrencyPatch.kt, which already declares a private top-level `Anchor`.
 * Kotlin reports a hard `Redeclaration` for a second same-named private top-level *class* in
 * one package, and then makes the first file's own references inaccessible. The sibling file
 * is not modified by this patch, so the collision is resolved on this side instead: the shape
 * (same five fields, same meaning, same two-phase application) is identical, only the
 * identifier differs. Same reasoning renames [ARM64_ITEM_ANCHORS] and [applyItemAnchors], and
 * is why the stub constants below are named after what they *do* (`BOOL_TRUE`, `BOOL_TRUE_W`,
 * `BOOL_FALSE`, `BRANCH_KEEP_SLOT`, `NOP_FALLTHROUGH`) rather than reusing the sibling's
 * `STUB_INT64` / `STUB_INT32`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The same rule applies to any stub added later.** Do not introduce a name the sibling
 * already uses — `Anchor`, `ARM64_ANCHORS`, `applyAnchors`, `STUB_INT64`, `STUB_INT32` are all
 * taken. Sites 11–14 added **no new stub constant at all** (they reuse [BOOL_TRUE_W]), so this
 * collision class is currently empty on this side.
 *
 * The `Item` prefix is the natural label for the merged 14-site scope (guns, gun skins, gloves,
 * drones, glove tile, the five gun-usability gates and the four glove/drone equip gates) *and*
 * the thing that keeps this file off the
 * sibling's names, so the two requirements point the same way. Note the asymmetry that makes
 * this legal: the collision rule applies to the top-level **class** only — the file-private
 * top-level **functions** `hex`, `indexOfAll` and `toHex` are legitimately duplicated between
 * this file and the sibling and are deliberately kept byte-identical. Do not "tidy" those
 * duplicates into a shared helper; only the class name is load-bearing here.

/**
 * Applies every [ItemAnchor] to [lib], guarded by a unique-anchor search.
 *
 * Two-phase so a bad build fails with **zero** bytes written:
 *  1. the library is slurped once and every 36-byte anchor is searched for, requiring
 *     **exactly one** occurrence (an 8-byte search would hit 24,734 times and a 12-byte one
 *     still 3 times at the guns site — and site 2 is ambiguous even at 16 bytes, so a shorter
 *     window would corrupt an unrelated function). This applies uniformly to the nine
 *     mid-function sites too: although their 4-byte instruction encodings are themselves unique
 *     in 85 MB, the full 36 bytes are searched and verified, because the window is what pins the
 *     collection load, the id load and the consumer, and therefore identifies *which*
 *     instruction it is;
 *  2. each resolved offset is re-read through a [RandomAccessFile], compared against the
 *     original bytes, and only then overwritten.
 *
 * Every write is the same length as the bytes it replaces — 8-over-8 at the six entry sites,
 * 4-over-4 at the nine mid-function sites, 76 bytes in total — so the patcher's
 * `lastModified`-keyed change diff
 * picks it up. Throws [PatchException] with full context if an anchor is missing or ambiguous,
 * or if the bytes on disk are not what we expect — i.e. new game build, unsupported version.
 * Because phase 1 completes for *all fourteen* anchors before phase 2 opens the file for writing,
 * a single bad anchor anywhere means zero bytes are modified.
