/**
 * Swamp Attack 2 v1.3.9 · **Unlimited Currency (static native patch)**.
 *
 * Unity IL2CPP title: game logic lives 100 % in `libil2cpp.so`, there is no
 * game DEX code (see notes/premium-bypass.md §3, targets C1–C8). This patch
 * edits the game's OWN `libil2cpp.so` bytes at patch time — both
 * `lib/arm64-v8a/` and `lib/armeabi-v7a/` — and writes them back in place.
 *
 * There is NO bytecodePatch here, NO companion `.so`, NO `System.loadLibrary`
 * trigger, and `UnityPlayerActivity.onCreate` is left 100 % stock. Nothing of
 * ours executes at launch, so launch can no longer crash from our code (the
 * old `UnsatisfiedLinkError` vector — injected `loadLibrary("SwampUnlimited")`
 * into `onCreate` — is gone with the deleted trigger patch).
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * WHAT IS FORCED — the safest always-true spend gates only (6 sites per ABI)
 * ============================================================================
 * Every site below returns `bool` and is overwritten at its first 8 bytes
 * with a return-true stub, so the original body (including the deduction)
 * never runs:
 *
 *   arm64  `mov w0, #1 ; ret`  = 20 00 80 52  C0 03 5F D6
 *   arm32  `mov r0, #1 ; bx lr` (ARM state) = 01 00 A0 E3  1E FF 2F E1
 *
 * Overwriting the prologue is safe: the stub returns immediately and never
 * touches the stack, so the discarded frame setup is simply never executed —
 * no `sp` imbalance, no link-register leak (`ret` / `bx lr` returns to the
 * untouched caller). The remaining bytes of each 16-byte verify window past
 * the 8-byte stub become unreachable dead code.
 *
 * Effect: `CanAfford*` always passes (shop buttons stay enabled) and every
 * `TryTake*` spend reports success WITHOUT deducting — coins, gems, cards,
 * boosters, premium ammo, every `GenericResourceType` is effectively free,
 * while real balances only grow.
 *
 * Additionally `PlayerProfile.GetResourceAmount` (C1) is pinned to return
 * 99,999,999 for EVERY resource type (see DISPLAY PIN below), so the wallet
 * HUD (`CurrencyPanelComponent`), shop prices and all other balance readouts
 * show an unlimited number instead of the real (low) balance.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * DISPLAY PIN — GetResourceAmount -> 99999999 (1 site per ABI)
 * ============================================================================
 * Target: `PlayerData.PlayerProfile.GetResourceAmount(GenericResource)`
 * (dump.cs TypeDef 830; script.json `PlayerData.PlayerProfile$$GetResourceAmount`).
 * The method is a 16-byte fast-path forwarder: load `inventory` (`[x0,#0x128]`
 * arm64 / `[r0,#0xC0]` arm32), null-check, zero the 3rd arg, tail-branch to
 * `ResourcePack.GetAmount` (arm64 RVA `0x1D18414`, arm32 `0xF02C98` —
 * confirmed via script.json, NOT via GetResourceAmount itself). Overwriting
 * the prologue with a constant-return stub is therefore safe by the same
 * argument as the spend gates (immediate return, no stack touched; the
 * null-inventory cold path becomes unreachable dead code — and the stub never
 * dereferences anything, so a null profile/inventory can no longer crash
 * here, it just reads 99,999,999).
 *
 * Stub (16 bytes, returns 99999999 = 0x5F5E0FF in the int return register):
 *
 *   arm64  `movz w0, #0xE0FF ; movk w0, #0x5F5, lsl #16 ; ret ; nop`
 *       =  E0 1F 9C D2  A0 BE A0 F2  C0 03 5F D6  1F 20 03 D5
 *   arm32  `movw r0, #0xE0FF ; movt r0, #0x5F5 ; bx lr ; nop` (ARM state)
 *       =  FF 00 0E E3  F5 05 40 E3  1E FF 2F E1  00 00 A0 E1
 *
 * Gate widths are deliberately WIDE (32 bytes / 8 words, all verified
 * byte-exact against the issue XAPK's own splits):
 * * arm64 needs only 16 (word 4 `1400F439` already differs from every
 *   `CanAfford` prologue), but 32 pins the forwarder + the null-path head.
 * * arm32 NEEDS >16: the first 16 bytes of `GetResourceAmount` are
 *   byte-identical to `CanAfford(ResourcePack)` and
 *   `CanAfford(InventoryItem)` (`E92D4830 E59050C0 E1A04001 E3550000` —
 *   same compiler prologue shape). Word 6 disambiguates (`EBF983D3` vs
 *   `EBF983F6`/`EBF983EB`), so the 32-byte gate can never mis-hit a spend
 *   gate even though the pinned offsets already differ.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TRADEOFF VERDICT — return-constant (all types) vs type-conditional (Currency)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The preferred `max(real, 99999999)`-only-for-`Currency` was considered and
 * REJECTED for a static patch; return-constant-99999999 is implemented:
 *
 * 1. A conditional needs ~24–36 bytes (`ldr w8,[x1,#typeOff]` + `cmp #1` +
 *    `b.eq` + 12-byte constant stub + reconstructed original prologue for the
 *    fall-through). `GetResourceAmount` owns only 16 bytes before its
 *    null-inventory cold path; the check would have to destroy that cold
 *    path (startup crash risk — the exact thing this patch must never
 *    cause) or the tail-branch setup. No clean fit.
 * 2. The type offset DIFFERS per ABI (`GenericResource.ResourceType` is at
 *    `0x20` arm64 but `0x10` arm32 — dump.cs TypeDef 1939 in each dump), so
 *    one shared stub is impossible; two hand-encoded conditional stubs would
 *    double the mis-assembly risk with no runtime to test-branch.
 * 3. Blast-radius analysis (41 BL xrefs per ABI, resolved via script.json):
 *    every in-game caller is either DISPLAY (wallet HUD
 *    `CurrencyPanelComponent.Setup`, `ResourceChangeListener` x3, `ShopItem`
 *    / `ShopScreen` price lines, spin/character/reward popups) or
 *    BENIGN-LOGIC that an inflated value only helps (redneck upgrade counts
 *    with `TryTake` already forced true, `CardsUntilUpgrade`, spin
 *    eligibility, missing-resource popups). The spend path itself does NOT
 *    consult this method (`CanAfford` forwards to `ResourcePack.CanAfford`,
 *    `HasResource` calls `ResourcePack`-level helpers directly — both
 *    verified by disassembly), and the stored `ResourcePack` inventory is
 *    never modified, so saves + cloud uploads keep REAL amounts; only live
 *    reads inflate. Worst observable effects: non-currency counts (cards,
 *    boosters, ammo, ooze, skins) DISPLAY 99,999,999 in upgrade/craft popups,
 *    and dev-analytics (`AnalyticsHelper.SendResourcesStatus` etc.) logs big
 *    balances. No save corruption, no logic inversion, no crash vector.
 *    This matches the old runtime engine's visible behaviour (wallet reads
 *    unlimited) while game progression stays spend-free via the gates.
 * Callers that could observe inflated non-currency counts: `GameData.
 * FilterRednecks`, `OffersManager.CardsUntilUpgrade`, `MainMenuScreen.
 * CheckForNewRednecks`, `RedneckInfoPopup.SetupRedneck/OnUpgrade`,
 * `CharacterSlot.UpdateData`, `RewardCard.Setup`, `MissingCardsPopup.Setup`,
 * `PremiumWeaponPopup.Setup`, `WinReward.Setup`, `BattlePassSeason.
 * InitializeSeason`, spin-wheel UI, `RestoreManager.ReportRestoreOffered`
 * (x4), `CloudOnceManager.SetCloudProfile` (x2, diff/log reads only),
 * `AnalyticsHelper.*` (x4). None gate correctness on the exact value.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * SITES — RVAs from dump.cs + script.json, gate words from the shipping libs
 * ============================================================================
 * arm64 file offset = RVA − 0x4000 (R-E LOAD off 0x1905AB0 = vaddr 0x1909AB0,
 * verified from the ELF program headers of the issue XAPK's own
 * config.arm64_v8a.apk split). arm32 file offset = RVA (single R-E LOAD at
 * off 0 / vaddr 0). All 12 first-16-byte gate words were verified byte-exact
 * against the issue XAPK's own splits (which are sha256-identical to
 * analysis/.../native/libil2cpp.so and .../il2cpp32/libil2cpp.so).
 *
 * Each site is gated on its exact 16 expected bytes at the pinned offset: a
 * mismatch SKIPS that site (logged, never written blind). A new game build
 * therefore degrades to fewer (or zero) gates instead of corrupting the lib.
 * If zero sites apply across both ABIs the patch throws [PatchException]
 * rather than shipping a silent no-op.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * DELIBERATELY LEFT OUT (v1 — minimal by design)
 * ============================================================================
 * * `GetResourceAmount` balance pin — not needed: balances never decrease,
 *   so the real display value is already "enough". Skips display-layer risk.
 *   (v2: ADDED — see DISPLAY PIN above. The v1 caution is superseded: the
 *   forwarder shape + xref analysis showed a constant stub is as safe as the
 *   spend gates, and the user explicitly wants the visible number unlimited.)
 * * `HasResource` x2, `ResourcePack` pack-side gates x5 — redundant for the
 *   spend loop (profile-level `TryTake` covers the documented funnel).
 * * `HandleAddingResource` grant multiplier — needs a trampoline/relocation
 *   mechanism; out of scope for a static v1 with no runtime code.
 * * `AdsData` native ads gates — out; ads are covered by the separate
 *   ABI-independent Java `../ads/AdRemovalPatch` (rewarded offers behave
 *   stock: real ad, real reward).
 * * `SetResourceAmount`, IAP grant (`OnSuccessfulPurchaseForRealCurrency`),
 *   server-validation bypass, adjustment path — untouched, see
 *   notes/premium-bypass.md I1–I3 (server-validated receipts can't be forged
 *   statically; not attempted).
 * * No new `.so` files, no manifest/DEX edits, no trampolines/relocation.
