/**
 * Static wrapper invoked from smali to replace the entire body of
 * NetworkingKt.getOkHttpClient() with a no-arg static call.
 *
 * Strategy — method body replacement at offset 0:
 *   invoke-static {}, PeacockAdPatchHelper;->buildOkHttpClient()LOkHttpClient;
 *   move-result-object v0
 *   return-object v0
 *
 * Why offset 0 with no args:
 *   All previous attempts inserted mid-method (offset 5) and passed v0
 *   (the Builder) as an argument. The ART verifier rejected this with
 *   type=Undefined (v1.4.56) and type=Conflict (v1.4.57) because inserting
 *   instructions mid-method leaves the verifier's register type-tracking
 *   in an ambiguous state at the merge point.
 *
 *   Inserting at offset 0 with {} (no register arguments) is unconditionally
 *   safe — no registers are live yet, so the verifier has nothing to conflict.
 *   move-result-object v0 assigns a fresh object into an uninitialized register,
 *   which the verifier always accepts. return-object v0 follows cleanly.
 *
 *   The original method body (Builder + OkHttpWorkaroundInterceptor + build())
 *   is never reached. buildOkHttpClient() replicates it in full, adding
 *   AdBlockInterceptor first so both interceptors are chained.
