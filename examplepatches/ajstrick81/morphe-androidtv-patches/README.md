## 📥 How to Install

All patches follow the same general workflow using **Morphe Manager**:

1. Download the correct **Android TV** `.apkm` from APKMirror — use the direct links below
2. Open Morphe Manager and select the `.apkm` file
3. Apply the patch

> ⚠️ **Get the Android TV build, not the phone or Fire TV build.** Each direct
> link below points at the app's **Android TV** listing on APKMirror. Several of
> these apps ship a separate phone build and/or a Fire TV build under the *same*
> package name — those will patch incorrectly or not at all. On the listing,
> match the **exact version** named below and download the **`.apkm`** (App
> Bundle), not a single-arch `.apk`.

### 🎬 Disney+

1. Open the **[Disney+ (Android TV) listing on APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/disney/disney-android-tv/)** and select version **`26.9.2+rc1-2026.06.12`**
2. Download the `.apkm` file
3. Select it in Morphe Manager
4. Apply the patch

---

### 🎭 HBO Max

1. Open the **[HBO Max (Android TV) listing on APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/warnermedia-direct-llc/max-stream-hbo-tv-movies-android-tv/)** and select version **`7.5.0.73`** (or the fallback `7.2.0.41`)

3. Select it in Morphe Manager
4. Apply the patch

---

### ▶️ Prime Video

1. Open the **[Prime Video (Android TV) listing on APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/amazon-mobile-llc/prime-video-android-tv-android-tv/)** and select version **`6.23.23+v15.5.0.70-armv7a`**
2. Download the `.apkm` file
3. Select it in Morphe Manager
4. Apply the patch

> 🛡️ **Recommended: run the DNS filter alongside the patch.** Prime Video picks
> its ad-delivery path server-side; the bytecode patch covers the "Java road"
> while a DNS blocklist covers the "native road" the patch can't see. See
> [**dns/README.md**](dns/README.md) for the list and the dual-layer rationale.

### 📡 Pluto TV

> 🟢 **Working.** Pluto is a free, 100% ad-supported (FAST) service that uses
> **server-side ad stitching (SSAI)** — ads are baked into the same stream as
> the content, so there is no ad domain to block and no ad-free tier to unlock.
> This patch empties the client-side ad-break timeline, which removes **on-demand
> (VOD)** ad breaks entirely: ad video, timeline markers, overlays, and tracking
> beacons. **LIVE TV** ads are real broadcast time in the linear feed and are not
> removable. DNS filters do **not** help here.

1. Open the **[Pluto TV (Android TV) listing on APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/pluto-inc/pluto-tv-android-tv/)** and select version **`5.66.0-leanback`**
2. ⚠️ Use this **Android TV** listing and pick a **`-leanback`** build — not the phone or Fire TV build
3. Download the `.apkm` file
4. Select it in Morphe Manager
5. Apply the patch
