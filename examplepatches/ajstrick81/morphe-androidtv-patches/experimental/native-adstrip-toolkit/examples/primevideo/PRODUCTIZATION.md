# Productization plan — PV ATV in-process ad-strip (PC bench → Morphe patch)

Status (2026-07-21): the strip is **verified working on a PC bench** (`frida/cmod-strip2.js` over
adb + the installed Frida-gadget build). Ads removed, playback healthy, 0 errors across many
movies. It is **not** persistent — the strip logic lives on the PC and must be attached each
session. This doc is the path from that bench result to an installable, no-PC Morphe patch.

See `frida/README.md` for the mechanism and findings. This doc is the transition plan only.

---

## 1. The core shift — where the "work" moves

| Piece | Now (bench) | Must become (patch) |
|---|---|---|
| Hook engine | Frida Gum (`Interceptor.attach`) | inline-hook lib compiled into a `.so` |
| Filter + strip logic | CModule C (`find_marker`) + JS (`parseElems`/`blankRanges`) | all in C, inside the `.so` |
| Loader | `ssl_driver2.py` attaches over adb each session | the APK loads the `.so` itself at startup |

Key leverage: `cmod-strip2.js`'s CModule C (`find_marker`, `scan_arg`, size gate) ports **almost
verbatim**. Only the blanking (`parseElems` + `blankRanges` + same-length space-fill) is still
JavaScript and must be rewritten in C. That is the main net-new code.

## 2. What a Morphe patch must do (three jobs)

1. **Bundle** the compiled `.so` into `lib/armeabi-v7a/` of the APK.
2. **Load** it early (inject `System.loadLibrary` / a `JNI_OnLoad` trigger) so the hook is armed
   before the first PRS fetch.
3. **Hook** `memcpy`/`memmove` from inside the `.so` (`JNI_OnLoad`), running the complete-array-
   only blank.

## 3. Reuse vs. replace in the existing scaffold

**Reuse (plumbing is sound):**
- `extension/NativeHookLoader.java` — the load trigger.
- `patch/BundleNativeHookPatch.kt`, `patch/LoadNativeHookPatch.kt`, `patch/Fingerprints.kt` — the
  Morphe patch that bundles the `.so` + injects the loadLibrary call.
- `jni/CMakeLists.txt`, `jni/sigscan.cpp`/`sigmatch.h` (if we later hook by signature).

**Replace (built around the WRONG seam):**
- `jni/offsets.h` — `inflate@0xd32f7a` / `SSL_read@0xc4fe3c` are DEAD ends. Not our hook target.
- `jni/hooks.cpp`, `jni/inflate_filter.h`, `jni/manifest_filter.*`, `ssl_reassembly.h` — written to
  hook inflate/SSL_read. The new target is **libc `memcpy`/`memmove`** with the complete-array rule.
- `jni/prs_filter.{cpp,h}` — has an in-process PRS strip already (host-tested), but its trigger
  assumed the inflate path AND it *shrinks* the buffer (wrong for the fixed-length memcpy copy).
  Its transform idea (drop `type:"Remote"`) was the seed for the §5 port below.

  **DONE (§5):** the memcpy-seam transform now lives in `jni/prs_blank.{cpp,h}` +
  `jni/test_prs_blank.cpp` — a faithful C port of `cmod-strip2.js` doing SAME-LENGTH,
  complete-array-only blanking (75 host checks, mutation-verified). `prs_filter` is superseded by
  it for the memcpy path and can be retired once `prs_blank` is wired into the `.so` loader.

## 4. Two tracks

### Track A — Frida-gadget auto-load (fast; stepping stone, do first)
The installed gadget can auto-load a script from a baked-in config at startup — no PC.
- **Do:** bundle `cmod-strip2.js` + a gadget config (`libfrida-gadget.config.so` →
  `type: script`, path to the JS) into the APK; confirm the gadget loads it on cold start and
  re-arms across PV's frequent process respawns.
- **Win:** a real no-PC, multi-day cold-start stability soak with ~zero new code — exactly the
  test to run next. De-risks Track B (if a permanent gadget-loaded strip is stable for days, the
  `.so` will be too).
- **Cost/why not ship it:** ships the Frida gadget (bulky, easily detected, not a clean Morphe
  patch). Stepping stone, not the release.

### Track B — ShadowHook `.so` + Morphe patch (endgame; the release)
- **Hook lib:** `bytedance/android-inline-hook` (ShadowHook). **Dobby is a confirmed dead end** —
  do not retry. Vendor + build for `armeabi-v7a` via NDK 28.2.
- **`.so` behavior** (`JNI_OnLoad`): resolve `memcpy`/`memmove`, inline-hook them; in the hook run
  the ported C: size gate `512..N`, `find_marker` for `intraTitlePlaylist":[`, parse the whole
  array, and **only if it is COMPLETE** (closing `]`, no truncated element) blank each
  `{"type":"Remote",...}`+comma with spaces; then call the original. Skip truncated buffers.
- **Bundle + load:** existing `patch/` Kotlin. **Verify:** logcat tag (e.g. `PVNativeHook`)
  logging "blanked N Remote in complete array" — verify the EFFECT on-device, not just "Applied".
- **Ship:** Morphe CLI patches stock APK → self-sign → install → cold-start verify → branch → PR →
  merge → semantic-release.

**Recommendation:** Track A for the multi-day soak, then Track B for release.

## 5. JS → C porting spec (the one piece of net-new code) — ✅ DONE

Ported from `cmod-strip2.js` into `jni/prs_blank.{cpp,h}`, host-tested in
`jni/test_prs_blank.cpp` (75 checks, all green; each mutation-verified to fail when the code
breaks — build/run per HANDOFF.md "Re-verify"). Function names mirror the JS for side-by-side diff:
- `scan_val` — string/nesting-aware value scanner; returns a **truncation sentinel** (`-1`) if a
  value has no closing quote/brace within the buffer (this is what makes "complete only" safe).
- `parse_complete` — parses the array from `[`; returns false if ANY element is truncated or the
  array never closes with `]`. False ⇒ do not touch the buffer (black-screen safety).
- `blank_ranges` — blanks each `Remote` element + surplus commas with 0x20 spaces. Same length ⇒
  JSON stays valid, buffer length unchanged.
- `find_marker` — cheap byte-anchor (`intraTitlePlaylist":[`) before any parse; parse only on a
  hit. (Host build uses a small `std::vector` for the element list; the `.so` hot path can swap in
  a fixed-size stack array — the array only builds on a marker hit, which is rare.)

**⚠️ Bug found & fixed during the port — read before touching `blank_ranges`.** The JS
`blankRanges` rule ("blank each Remote + its *own* trailing comma; for a *trailing* Remote blank
the *preceding* comma") leaves a **trailing comma → invalid JSON** for 2+ consecutive Remote
elements at the array tail (`[Main,Remote,Remote]` → `[Main, ]`). The bench never hit it (content
playlists end on a `Main`), so on every shape it validated the two are byte-identical. The C port
uses a correct rule instead — *keep exactly the comma after each surviving element that still has a
survivor after it* — which produces valid JSON even when ads are last (guarded by the `tail2` test,
important for the denser TV-show playlists §6.1 flags). **When wiring the `.so`, use this rule, not
the JS one; and if you re-derive from `cmod-strip2.js`, port `prs_blank.cpp`'s comma logic, not the
JS `blankRanges`.**

## 6. Must-resolve BEFORE release

1. **TV shows — root cause found; the transform-side fix is built.** The bench got movies 100% but
   TV markers survived. This is NOT a transform gap: the MITM rig proved the *same*
   `type:"Remote"` PRS strip cleans movies AND TV. It is an **interception-completeness** gap. The
   push-seam blanker (`prs_blank`) can only act on a COMPLETE array inside ONE copy; the larger/
   denser TV playlist arrives only as truncated chunks (and/or exceeds the 256KB size gate, §6.4),
   so every chunk is safely skipped and the ads stay. **`jni/prs_reassembly.h` (`PrsReassembler`)
   restores the rig's whole-body discipline** in-process — accumulate the body, strip the COMPLETE
   body once via `filter_prs` (free to shrink; we re-serve), hand back any chunk sizes. Host-tested
   incl. chunk-boundary invariance + a >300KB TV fixture that per-chunk blanking strips 0 of and
   the reassembler strips all of (`test_prs_reassembly.cpp`, 28 checks, mutation-verified).
   **Still device-side:** reassemble-and-re-serve needs a PULL seam (SSL_read/inflate/a read
   wrapper), NOT the one-shot memcpy PUSH seam movies use. Finding the whole-body PRS pull point in
   libignite is the open Ghidra task; the scaffold's old `inflate@0xd32f7a` guess was disproven by
   the bench, so re-hunt it. Verify TV on-device before declaring covered.
2. **Complete-copy assumption (push seam only)** — the `prs_blank` movies path relies on the full
   array arriving in one large copy (`libc.so+0x3ea01` / `libignite+0xae44a5`). Content-keyed
   (`arrayClosed` + Remote), so version-robust, but validate across more titles and after an app
   update. (The reassembler removes this assumption for whatever seam it wires to.)
3. **Permanent-hook perf** — a lifetime memcpy hook vs. a session-long one. Measure playback perf
   over hours; confirm the gate keeps overhead negligible.
4. **Size gate upper bound** — currently `512..262144`. A very long movie/series could exceed
   256KB; raise the bound without reintroducing scan cost on huge video copies.
5. **Idempotence / multi-copy** — confirm blanking the first complete copy reliably reaches the
   parser across titles (bench showed 1–2 complete-copy sites per load; all blanked cleanly).

## 7. Recommended sequence

1. Track A: bake gadget auto-load; run the multi-day cold-start soak (movies).
2. TV shows: on-device, capture a TV PRS body and confirm the ads are `type:"Remote"` items (the
   rig's finding). Find the whole-body PRS **pull** seam in libignite (Ghidra), then wire
   `PrsReassembler` (`prs_reassembly.h`) to it — transform + tests already done. As a cheap first
   experiment, also try just raising `prs_blank`'s `kMaxScan` in case the complete copy merely
   exceeds 256KB.
3. Track B: vendor ShadowHook, port the C, wire the memcpy hook into the scaffold's loader+patch.
4. On-device logcat verify (effect, not "Applied"); breadth test movies + TV.
5. Branch → PR → `gh pr checks --watch` → merge → semantic-release.
