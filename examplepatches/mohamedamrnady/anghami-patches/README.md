# 🎵 Anghami patches by Nady

Morphe patches for [Anghami](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anghami) (`com.anghami`).

## ❓ About

Client-side patches for Anghami **8.0.28** (versionCode `8000280`, APKM) that relax
locally-enforced gates: Plus checks, playback/download restrictions, forced shuffle,
upgrade upsell UI, in-house ads, and Gold-gated rows. Everything here hooks **local
boolean gates** — stream/download URLs, audio quality authorization, and plan data
from `/authenticate` remain server-enforced, so anything the server refuses still
fails after patching.

**🎯 Supported versions:**

| 8.0.28 |
| :---: |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Hide Gold features](#hide-gold-features) | Forces Account.isGold/isGoldUser and all GoldUtilsKt.isGold overloads to false. Hides server-gated Gold UI instead of spoofing it. |  |
| [Hide upgrade upsell](#hide-upgrade-upsell) | Forces getPlusTab/getHasRestrictedQueue=false, collapses the HeaderBar promo banner (GONE), and no-ops flyer onAdLoaded. |  |
| [Remove ads](#remove-ads) | No-ops custom popup funnels (popupwindow + fullscreen startup dialog), hides upsell-deeplink feed cards (ButtonModel + LinkModel) at bind time, and drops the settings subscribe banner by nulling its server-question/upgrade-model sources. |  |
| [Spoof stock app signature](#spoof-stock-app-signature) | Forces SignatureUtils.getAppSignature to hash with the stock cert prefix (he9B...kw=), so X-ANGH-APP-RGSIG matches a stock install. Salt/body hashing unchanged. |  |
| [Unforce shuffle](#unforce-shuffle) | No-ops PlayQueue.shuffle(), forces server shuffleOn=false at both sync points, disables the pick-a-song radio redirect, enables shuffle buttons, and disarms the shuffle upsell dialog. Manual shuffle toggle keeps working. |  |
| [Unlock local Plus](#unlock-local-plus) | Forces Account.isPlus/isPlusUser=true, enablePlayerRestrictions=false, canPlayOfflineAndFree=true. Local UI/gating only; server premium checks remain. |  |
| [Unlock playback/download restrictions](#unlock-playback-download-restrictions) | Forces skip/queue limits off, download asserts no-op, limited-plan false, noAd true, max offline 999999. Local gates only. |  |

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

For research and interoperability purposes. Spoofing entitlement on a commercial
streaming service can violate its Terms of Service — use a throwaway account,
expect server-gated features (full lyrics, high-quality streams, downloads) to
keep failing, and do not redistribute patched APKs as "Premium Unlocked".
