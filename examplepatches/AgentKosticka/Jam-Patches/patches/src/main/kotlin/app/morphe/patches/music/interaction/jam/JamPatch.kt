/**
 * # Jam patch boundary
 *
 * `JamPatch.kt` wires dependencies, resources and preferences. `Fingerprints.kt` contains semantic
 * entry points: queue diagnostics, platform calls, and native view resource names. `JamAbi.kt` and
 * `JamUiAbi.kt` resolve native relationships from those matches. They must fail on missing or
 * ambiguous targets; do not add obfuscated class/method names or select an arbitrary candidate to
 * make a version patch successfully.
 *
 * The installers add casts, field accessors, native calls and interception points. `JamBridge.kt`
 * contains their shared method emitter. Use the project's `BytecodeUtils` instruction matching and
 * reverse-index helpers for insertion; keep queue policy and UI behavior in
 * `extensions/music/.../jam`.
 *
 * In particular:
 * - Host playback uses `MediaController.TransportControls.skipToQueueItem` with the native
 *   persistent item ID. The queue mutation notifier is **not** a play operation. Never substitute
 *   an enqueue endpoint on playback failure.
 * - `JamClock.playHost` confirms the selected ID and playing state off the native queue executor.
 *   Paused selection is resumed only once the requested ID is active.
 * - Player metadata is handled by `JamMetadata`, which overrides the actual full-player and
 *   mini-player `setText` calls. The presenter is found through `player_page`, `mini_player_title`
 *   and `mini_player_subtitle` resources. All caching, text selection and restoration run in Java
 *   on the UI thread; no timer races or custom text-register dataflow analysis are needed.
 * - Queue lane selection, bounds checking and reorder predecessor calculation are extension
 *   interface defaults. Smali only exposes native primitives.
 *
 * The native ABI resolver is still substantial because Jam mirrors YTM's native observable queue,
 * item models, gestures and player components. Removing literal obfuscation names does not prove
 * compatibility with uninspected versions. Runtime integration remains opt-in. Compatibility is
 * restricted to the exact APK versions that have passed the local validation gates.
 *
 * ## Compatibility and release gates
 *
 * YT Music 9.15.51 ARM64 remains the baseline. Versions 9.35.54, 9.36.50 and 9.37.54 are
 * experimental targets with local patch, SDK DEX verification and APK construction evidence.
 * Device acceptance for these versions is pending. See docs/experimental-versions.md.
 *
 * Discovery follows `APK -> Fingerprint -> JamQueueAbi/JamUiAbi -> validation -> installation`.
 * Dynamic fingerprints may consume earlier resolved types. Android calls, diagnostics, resources,
 * `methodCall` and `fieldAccess` relationships take precedence over implementation names. Clock
 * model construction and inaccessible native operations remain bridges; clock defaults, drag
 * policy, metadata fallback and queue decisions live in extension Java. No obfuscated version
 * branches are permitted. More than one valid semantic candidate must fail, including within an
 * alternative resolver; an unrelated candidate with no capability may be discarded.
 *
 * `JamPatchRegressionTest` uses the real patch and supplied APK, including negative fixtures with
 * missing and duplicate required constructors. `validateJam` requires an Android SDK and uses
 * `SdkDexVerifier` before constructing the output APK. A normal Gradle build alone is not release
 * evidence. Run it with `-PjamApk` and `-PjamOutput`; omitting the APK skips fixture tests and
 * cannot satisfy release gates.
 *
 * Every additional experimental version needs unique resolution, ABI validation, full patch
 * application, SDK bytecode verification and APK construction. Promotion from experimental support
 * also requires installation and the same two-device smoke matrix as the baseline. Preserve the
 * experimental target flag until that evidence exists for the exact version.
 *
 * The local Binder bridge advertises additive protocol version 1 and capabilities
 * `queue-revisions`, `stable-item-ids` and `stale-edit-rejection`. Missing envelopes are treated as
 * the original v1 bridge; malformed envelopes, unsupported required versions and missing
 * capabilities are rejected. Network framing is unchanged. Pairing binds the selected package names
 * to a locally generated capability token. Companion forks may use their own signing keys without
 * modifying the patch.
 *
 * Experimental prereleases may be published after the local gates for user device testing. Test
 * the published prerelease through a clean Morphe Manager setup, including source metadata, patch
 * discovery, dependency resolution, APK building, installation, two-device pairing and reconnect.
 * Local artifacts do not satisfy that consumer gate. Keep the upstream PR draft and its review
 * threads unresolved until the coordinated evidence supports the responses.
 *
 * Device testing is performed manually by the user for this release. Never infer a pass from
 * installation or a build. Remote transport controls, bulk/playlist/offline enqueue, exhaustive
 * Doze/network stress, separate radio-loss failover and physical camera validation remain
 * documented limitations.
