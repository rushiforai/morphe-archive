/**
 * Anchor for the whole sidebar-builder class. Matches the method that builds
 * the "add a remote connection" list (sharebrowser, http, ftp, smb, webdav,
 * flashair, bluetooth, ...) via its own two real (unobfuscated) protocol-scheme
 * string literals - a pair unique to this one feature. Every other fingerprint
 * below pins `classFingerprint` to this one, so none of them can ever match a
 * method in some unrelated class elsewhere in the app - the bug that broke the
 * previous version of this patch (an unscoped fingerprint silently matched an
 * unrelated method elsewhere that also happened to contain the word "root").
 *
 * `accessFlags = PRIVATE` matters here specifically: `<clinit>` builds the
 * very array these two scheme strings live in, so it contains both literals
 * too and would otherwise satisfy this same filter chain. `<clinit>` is a
 * static constructor, never private, so pinning PRIVATE is what keeps this
 * fingerprint pointed at the real method (R()) instead of silently gutting
 * the class's static array initializers - exactly what broke the sidebar on
 * the first build of this rewrite (NPEs in R()/T() reading now-null arrays).

 * unobfuscated JDK calls that occur back-to-back nowhere else in the class: an
 * IGET_OBJECT read of a List field, immediately cleared via the real
 * `java.util.List#clear()`, immediately followed by a re-read of the same
 * shape of field, an obfuscated 0-arg factory returning the real
 * `java.util.ArrayList`, and immediately repopulated via the real
 * `java.util.List#addAll(Collection)`. A near-identical clear+refill idiom
 * exists elsewhere in this class (a conditional "refresh" method), but there
 * it's separated by other instructions rather than fully back-to-back, so
 * requiring every step immediately after the last is what keeps this
 * fingerprint pointed at only this one method.

 * twice - once here, and once in a static array initializer that has no
 * equals-call after it at all - so this shape alone already disambiguates the
