# 👋🧩 FTL Patches

Personal collection of my Morphe Patches.

## ❓ About

Strips ads and analytics/crash-reporting SDKs at the bytecode level, cleans build artifacts and dex debug info, trims resource bloat — unused density buckets, unused language packs, lossless PNG recompression — and lets you scale the app's display density independent of system settings, for smaller, cleaner APKs.

**🎯 Supported versions:**

| 18.8.0.prime |
| :---: |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Clean main UI](#clean-main-ui) | Hides the bottom navigation bar, the top-right guide icon, and the Rate/Help/About drawer items, keeps the connect/create/join buttons on top, and stops them from being auto-hidden. Reapplied on create, resume, and drawer open (and retried for ~1.8s after each) since some of these views are inflated lazily. |  |
| [Skip splash screen](#skip-splash-screen) | Jumps straight to the main activity from the splash screen, skipping the splash animation entirely. Also restores the storage-permission request and local media scan that the splash screen normally performs, so the Apps/Photo/Video tabs still load. |  |
| [Speed up splash screen](#speed-up-splash-screen) | Enters the main activity directly after the splash permission check instead of delaying for the additional external-storage check. |  |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [APK Junk Cleanup](#apk-junk-cleanup) | Removes build artifacts and metadata that bloat the APK: Play Services / Firebase version files, protobuf descriptors, debug probes, kotlin builtins, META-INF subfolder clutter, and misc junk. Safe — only removes files with no runtime purpose. | • Keep Only One Architecture<br>• Target architecture |
| [Add Toast](#add-toast) | Shows a custom toast message when the app starts. Works on any app. | • Toast message<br>• Show once |
| [Custom DPI](#custom-dpi) | Change any app's display size without touching your phone's system settings. Make it bigger if things look too small, or smaller to fit more on screen. You Need To Configure 100(No Change), 90(10% Smaller App Ui), 110(10% Bigger App Ui). | • Display scale |
| [Png Optimizer](#png-optimizer) | Compresses PNG images without losing quality and strips hidden metadata (DPI, timestamps, text) to make the app smaller. Only rewrites files when the result is actually smaller. |  |
| [Remove Ads](#remove-ads) | Stubs known ad SDK entry points and poisons ad-network URL strings across the whole app. Async load calls are redirected into the callback's own failure method instead of being deleted, Currently In Some Apps Makes Them Stuck In SplashActivity Due To Their Custom Check Of Ads Load But It Is Superior. |  |
| [Remove Ads Lite(Adobo)](#remove-ads-lite-adobo) | Based On (Adobo's Block Ads+Mobile Ads) Disables known ad SDK entry points and neutralizes ad/tracker/analytics Safer than Remove Ads for apps where you will be stuck in SplashActivity It Is Weaker But Effective, Merged Adobo's Both Patches And Removed The Need Of Selecting A Host File Or Configuring Anything In Future It May Replace Remove Ads Patch If I Find No Problem. | • Redirection IP<br>• Additional hosts file (optional) |
| [Remove Ads Ultra Lite](#remove-ads-ultra-lite) | Call finish on ad activities (AdMob, AppLovin MAX, BIGO, InMobi, Liftoff/Vungle) Its In Very Early Stage So Test And Provide FeedBack If You Still See Ads In Some App. |  |
| [Remove Analytics](#remove-analytics) | Disables tracking and crash-reporting tools, corrupts analytics web links inside the code, and removes background tracking services. |  |
| [Remove Debug Info](#remove-debug-info) | Removes debug information (line numbers, variable names, source file references) from every class in the .dex files to reduce overall APK size. |  |
| [Remove Duplicate Graphics](#remove-duplicate-graphics) | Keeps images for only one screen density (like xhdpi) and removes copies for all other densities. Android will automatically scale the kept images, making the app significantly smaller. | • Target density |
| [Remove Languages](#remove-languages) | Removes translations for languages you don't use across ALL resource types (strings, drawables, layouts, raw, xml, etc.). Only keeps the languages you pick. Base resources with no language code are always preserved. | • Languages to keep |
