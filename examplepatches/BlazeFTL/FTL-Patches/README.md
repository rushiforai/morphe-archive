# 👋🧩 FTL Patches

Personal collection of my Morphe Patches

## ❓ About

Strips ads and analytics/crash-reporting SDKs at the bytecode level, cleans build artifacts and dex debug info, trims resource bloat — unused density buckets, unused language packs, lossless PNG recompression — and lets you scale the app's display density independent of system settings, for smaller, cleaner APKs.

**🎯 Supported versions:**

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Clean main UI](#clean-main-ui) | Hides the bottom navigation bar, the top-right guide icon, and the Rate/Help/About drawer items, and brings the connect/create/join buttons to front. Reapplied on create, resume, and drawer open (and retried for ~1.8s after each) since some of these views are inflated lazily. |  |
| [Skip splash screen](#skip-splash-screen) | Jumps straight from SplashActivity.onCreate() to the main activity, skipping the splash/guide UI and its permission flow entirely. |  |
| [Speed up splash screen](#speed-up-splash-screen) | Enters the main activity directly after the splash permission check instead of delaying for the additional external-storage check. |  |

<summary>🌐 Universal&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;9 patches</summary>
<br>

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [APK Junk Cleanup](#apk-junk-cleanup) | Removes build artifacts and metadata that bloat the APK: Play Services / Firebase version files, protobuf descriptors, debug probes, kotlin builtins, META-INF subfolder clutter, and misc junk. Safe — only removes files with no runtime purpose. | • Keep Only One Architecture<br>• Target architecture |
| [Add Toast](#add-toast) | Shows a custom toast message when the app starts. Works on any app. | • Toast message<br>• Show once |
| [Custom DPI (Universal)](#custom-dpi-universal) | Change this app's display size without touching your phone's system settings. Make it bigger if things look too small, or smaller to fit more on screen. Works on any app. | • Display scale |
| [Png Optimizer](#png-optimizer) | Compresses PNG images without losing quality and strips hidden metadata (DPI, timestamps, text) to make the app smaller. Only rewrites files when the result is actually smaller. |  |
| [Remove Ads](#remove-ads) | Stubs known ad SDK entry points and poisons ad-network URL strings across the whole app. |  |
| [Remove Analytics](#remove-analytics) | Disables tracking and crash-reporting tools, corrupts analytics web links inside the code, and removes background tracking services. |  |
| [Remove Debug Info](#remove-debug-info) | Removes debug information (line numbers, variable names, source file references) from every class in the .dex files to reduce overall APK size. |  |
| [Remove Duplicate Graphics](#remove-duplicate-graphics) | Keeps images for only one screen density (like xhdpi) and removes copies for all other densities. Android will automatically scale the kept images, making the app significantly smaller. | • Target density |
| [Remove Languages](#remove-languages) | Removes translations for languages you don't use across ALL resource types (strings, drawables, layouts, raw, xml, etc.). Only keeps the languages you pick. Base resources with no language code are always preserved. | • Languages to keep |
