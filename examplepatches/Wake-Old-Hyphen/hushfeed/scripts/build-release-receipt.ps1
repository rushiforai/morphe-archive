<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Build the machine-readable release provenance receipt.

.DESCRIPTION
    Local patching puts three things together: the user's APK, this bundle, and a toolchain. A
    checksum can only say that one of them arrived unaltered. This writes down all of it as one
    JSON document: which commit and tag the bundle was built from, what the bundle weighs and
    hashes to, which extension payloads it carries, which APK each proof was run against, that
    every patch in the catalog applied to it, and what patching did to the Android manifest.

    Nothing here is asserted. Each fixture is patched with the real desktop CLI, the verdicts
    come out of the CLI's own result report, and both manifests are read back with aapt2. A
    patch that fails on any fixture stops the run with its name and no receipt is written: the
    receipt describes a bundle that fully applies, which is why the validator refuses any
    verdict of applied = false rather than reading it as a recorded failure. At least one
    fixture has to be the catalog's declared version patched without -f, or there is nothing
    in the receipt a user's Manager run corresponds to.

    The patched APKs are working files and are deleted on the way out, including after a failure.

.EXAMPLE
    One -Fixture taking a comma separated list, not the switch repeated: PowerShell binds a
    parameter once and refuses the second.
