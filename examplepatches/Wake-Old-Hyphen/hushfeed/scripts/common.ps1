<#
.SYNOPSIS
    The helpers the release and verification scripts share.

.DESCRIPTION
    Dot-source this beside patch-target.ps1 and patch-report.ps1:

        . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'common.ps1')

    Each of these existed in two to four copies that had already drifted apart. The path guard
    was identical in three scripts; the cleanup helper recursed unconditionally in one and only
    on request in another; the version read appeared four times, twice without -LiteralPath; and
    the desktop CLI was looked up by two functions with different search orders, one returning
    $null and one throwing. Copies of a guard drift in the direction of whichever caller was
    edited last, which is the direction nobody checked.

function Resolve-WithinRoot {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        A generated path, proved to be inside the work directory, or a throw.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Every path these scripts hand to the patcher or delete afterwards goes through this, so
        a run identifier that came out wrong cannot reach outside the directory the caller owns.

function Remove-GeneratedPath {

    .SYNOPSIS
        Delete something this run generated, inside the work directory, warning rather than
        failing when it will not go.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Recursive by default, because every caller is deleting a run directory and the one copy
        that made it optional had its single caller pass -Recurse anyway. Pass -NoRecurse for a
        single file. A failure here is reported and swallowed on purpose: leaving scratch behind
        is not a reason to fail a run that has already produced its answer.

        The version in gradle.properties, which every generated name follows.
    .DESCRIPTION

        holding a bracket is read as a wildcard otherwise, and the read silently finds nothing.

function Get-ReleaseBundlePath {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Where :patches:buildAndroid leaves the bundle a release publishes.
    .DESCRIPTION
        patches/build/release, never patches/build/libs. The Morphe plugin's buildAndroid adds the
        DEX payload to the jar task's own output in place, so any later task that reruns
        :patches:jar (:patches:test does) wrote the plain jar back over the finished bundle under
        the same name. v0.43.0 shipped that jar, and on 2026-09-21 it happened again between the
        build and the index push. buildAndroid now ends by copying the finished bundle here, where
        no other task writes, with bundle.sha256 beside it.

function Get-SourcesNewerThanBundle {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        The source files written after the bundle was built, newest first.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Only :patches:buildAndroid writes the release bundle, and :patches:test rebuilds
        build/libs without it, so a device build made after a patch change and a test run
        patched with the previous hooks (2026-09-23, Swipe-left controls). Counted: the sources of
        the patches module and its submodules (patches/src/main, patches/<submodule>/src/main,
        the compile-only stubs among them, whose constants can be inlined into patch code), the
        sources of every extension module (extensions/<module>/src/main and
        extensions/<module>/<submodule>/src/main), the Gradle files that shape them, and the R8
        rules (*.pro at extensions/ and in each module, extensions/proguard-rules.pro being the
        one every extension's R8 step reads). Build output is never under src/main, so it is not
        walked.
