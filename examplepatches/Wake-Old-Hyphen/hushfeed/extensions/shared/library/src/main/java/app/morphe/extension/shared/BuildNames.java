 * <p>TikTok's build shortens most resource names to two or three characters and hands the same
 * short names out again on every build, mostly to other views: {@code g6r} is the like button on
 * 47.0.3 and something else on the next build. A name written {@code "47.0.3:g6r"} is 47.0.3's
 * name and resolves on 47.0.3 alone, so a list can carry each supported build's name for one view
 * without another build's name ever finding the wrong one. A name with no build in front is a
 * real name, the same on every build.
