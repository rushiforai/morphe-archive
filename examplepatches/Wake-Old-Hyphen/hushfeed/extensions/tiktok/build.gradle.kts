 * published, under assets/settings and at the top of assets/ both. The names do not line up
 * on their own: the light twins are a `-light` suffix here
 * and a `pages/light` directory there, the dialogs are their own tree, Feed navigation publishes
 * the scrolled-to-the-end capture, and the gate recorder is at the top level with a hyphen where
 * the published name has an underscore. Every pair below was checked byte for byte against a
 * capture of an unchanged tree, which is what makes this a mapping rather than a guess. Keyed
 * by path under assets/, because keying by bare name left overlay-controls.png, which the
 * README shows, outside the map and stale.
