 * underneath it, because the only thing that decides whether this is visible is whether the home
 * tab is selected. It also does not touch a single feed item, so the batch TikTok already
 * fetched is still sitting there when the hold ends, and nothing is refetched.

 * underneath it, because this covers the whole root and swallows every touch, so a banner
