/**
 * What each accepted save was doing, kept on disk so the start after a closed TikTok can say what
 * it left unfinished.
 *
 * <p>A record goes in as a save is accepted, gains a slot as each of its files reaches the gallery
 * and is closed when the job is over, whichever way it ended: the work reports its own result, so
 * a closed record has nothing left to say. Only a record still open at the next start, written by
 * a process that is gone, is read back. A slot confirmed published is done, whatever happened to
 * the file since. A slot that had its row or file but no confirmation is looked up, which is how a
 * publish that landed a moment before the process died still counts as done. A file the record
 * never reached did not finish.
 *
 * <p>It holds what that takes and nothing more: the kind of save, a random id, how many files it
 * expected, two timestamps, and for a file still in flight its MediaStore row, or on Android 9 and
 * older its path and expected size. A confirmed file keeps none of those. There is no address and
 * no token in it. The Android 9 path is the name of the reader's own file, which already sits in
 * shared storage under it, and a filename template can put the creator and the video id there;
 * it is kept only while that file is written and goes the moment it is confirmed. The records
 * file is private to TikTok and nothing exports, backs up or logs it: the log lines name kinds
 * and counts only, since they go into exported reports.
 *
 * <p>Bounded twice: records from earlier processes go after {@link #MAX_AGE_MS}, and past
 * {@link #MAX_RECORDS} the oldest of them go first. This process's own records are never dropped.
