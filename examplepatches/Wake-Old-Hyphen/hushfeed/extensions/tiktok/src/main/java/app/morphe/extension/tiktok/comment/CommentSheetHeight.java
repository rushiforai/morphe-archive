/**
 * What the Open the comments at full height patch asks while the comment sheet is sized
 * (issue #191).
 *
 * <p>TikTok sizes the comment sheet from a server mode: 68 or 73 percent of the screen, a ratio
 * it picks, or a fixed height from its resources when the mode is 0. The method that turns the
 * mode into pixels asks here first, and while the switch is on it hands back its sibling's
 * answer instead, trimmed to the room the window has between its system bars. The sheet's own sizing
 * asks for the mode too, and skips the pixels method when it is 0, so that answer is lifted to
 * a mode that goes through it. Dragging the sheet down to close is TikTok's own and still works.
 *
 * <p>Off, paused, or a failure in here, and the sheet opens at the height TikTok gave it.
