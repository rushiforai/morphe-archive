 * 30 fps video puts a 120 Hz phone at 30 Hz for as long as the app is in front. Android
 * reads zero as no preference, which is the phone's own choice, so that is what goes in
 * instead. Only a request slower than the screen can manage is treated that way: an app that
 * asks for the rate it already has, or for more, is asking for something else and is left to
 * it. Nothing here raises anything; it only declines to lower.
