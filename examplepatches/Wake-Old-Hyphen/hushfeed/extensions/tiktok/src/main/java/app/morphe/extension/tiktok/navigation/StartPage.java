/**
 * Picks the tab TikTok opens on when it starts from its icon.
 *
 * <p>TikTok's main activity works that tab out itself as it is created: the tab a notification
 * names, else a tab it saved, else one its own landing rules ask for, else Home. All of those end
 * at one comparison with "HOME", where the patch hands the tag to {@link #coldStartTag}, and the
 * tag that comes back goes through TikTok's own steps for a start on that tab: the splash theme is
 * put back for anything but Home, and Friends, Inbox and Profile each go through the handler
 * TikTok uses when a notification opens them.
 *
 * <p>For You and Following are feed tabs across the top of Home, and Home's pager picks between
 * them twice after the activity. As its view is built it switches to the tab TikTok's home page
 * service names, else For You ({@link #firstTopTab}). Once the first frame is up it moves to its
 * default page, which is Following only when TikTok's own "change follow tab" preference is on
 * for a signed-in account, and otherwise the tab it is on ({@link #followingFirst}). A start that
 * asked for either tab answers both for a short while after it.
 *
 * <p>Only a plain start from the launcher changes. A notification, a link or a shortcut keeps the
 * tab it asked for, and an activity Android restores keeps the tab it was on. Inbox also needs a
 * signed-in account, since TikTok sends a start there without one to its login screen.
