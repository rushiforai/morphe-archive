/**
 * Hides controls TikTok lays over the video player.
 *
 * Ids were read off the live view hierarchy of TikTok 47.0.3 with a video paused, apart from
 * the two search module ids, which were read off the module's code in the APK. Where 47.0.3
 * renamed a 46.x view, only the 47.0.3 name is looked up: TikTok hands the old short names
 * out again, and on 47.0.3 each one names some other view, which a fallback would have hidden
 * in any cell that lacked the current one.
 * <pre>
 *   df_search_biz:id/fo   the full screen layer the visual search prompt lives in, the root
 *                         of the layout SearchVisualSearchContainerComponentV2 inflates.
 *                         46.2.3 called it fb, which on 47.0.3 is a row of the visual search
 *                         camera page
 *   df_search_biz:id/d4   the clickable visual search pill, the root of both layouts the VTag
 *                         processors inflate. 46.2.3 called it cn, which on 47.0.3 is a row of
 *                         the floating card in search results
 *   id/k_5                the Live entrance, top left, 158 px square, no description
 *   id/liy                the interaction area over the video: the right-hand column's slots,
 *                         the caption block and the music row
 *   id/f7u                the root of every feed survey card; the cell's survey ViewStubs
 *                         carry no inflatedId, so the card keeps its own layout id. All
 *                         seven layouts those stubs inflate have it on 47.0.3, where 46.2.3
 *                         called it ezp (on 47.0.3 ezp is a label in the paid series panel).
 *                         It is a shared root id: the profile's Favorites page is a
 *                         LinearLayout with the same id.
 *   id/view_rootview      the root of every feed cell (VideoViewCellRootView). Every id below
 *                         it here is feed furniture and lives inside one. id/long_press_layout
 *                         is a sibling layer under it, not an ancestor of the rail: scoping
 *                         to that from 0.35.0 hid nothing in the right column (S22, 2026-09-17,
 *                         read off the live tree with the probe's views action).
 *   id/uvy                the strip across the top holding For You, Following and the rest
 *   id/i98 id/g6r id/ep7  the avatar, like and comment controls
 *   id/i7r id/pnp id/w_2  the favourite, music and share controls
 *   id/g6t id/ej_         the rows under like, comment, favourite and share
 *   id/i6r id/w6_         whose icon stays put when its count goes
 *   id/g6s id/ej9         the numeric TextViews inside those rows
 *   id/i6q id/w69
 * </pre>
 * The first two belong to TikTok's search dynamic feature module, so they resolve under
 * that module's package name rather than the app's. Views are re-hidden on every layout
 * pass, since TikTok shows the prompt again for each video that has something to search.
