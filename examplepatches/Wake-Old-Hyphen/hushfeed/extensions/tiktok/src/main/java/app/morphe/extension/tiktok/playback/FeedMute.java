/**
 * Mute feed videos: the feed plays silent until the reader turns the sound back on, without
 * touching the phone's volume, and other apps keep the audio while it is on.
 *
 * <p>A one-off {@code setVolume(0, 0)} doesn't stick, since every new video sets its own volume as
 * it prepares. What sticks is the feed player engine's own mute flag: TikTok never sets it on
 * these engines, and a native player created later is handed the stored flag. A new video can
 * come on a new engine, though, so the flag is set each time an engine starts playing a feed
 * video, at the top of its {@code play()}.
 *
 * <p>DMs, stories and LIVE replays play on the same engines. What tells a feed video apart is the
 * PlayerController that asked for it: this hears each controller play first, notes whether its
 * host is the feed activity and whether the video is a story or LIVE, and the engine's source id
 * (the video's id) is looked up in those notes when it plays. A video no feed controller asked
 * for, like one in a DM chat, has no note and keeps its sound.
 *
 * <p>TikTok takes the audio focus twice for a feed video: a lasting grant per player session and
 * a transient one each time a page resumes. While muted with a feed video in front both requests
 * are turned down, and the ones already held are given up when the mute is switched on.
