/**
 * Hides individual rows and header controls on TikTok's Inbox tab, and adds a Clear all
 * control to the Suggested accounts section.
 *
 * TikTok builds the Inbox as one RecyclerView, so rows are filtered as they lay out
 * rather than by editing TikTok's data. Every pass re-decides every row from its current
 * content, which keeps recycled views correct: a hidden row that gets reused for
 * something else is shown again on the next pass.
 *
 * Resource ids are TikTok 47.0.3's, the declared target, read off its live Inbox and its
 * precompiled row inflaters. No older build's name is kept as a fallback: TikTok hands the
 * same short names out again on every build, and on 47.0.3 each 46.x name here is some
 * other view.
