/**
 * Lets the video on screen play to its end when the budget runs out, and keeps the feed from
 * moving on meanwhile.
 *
 * <p>Without it the hold lands the moment the budget is spent, which is halfway through a video
 * for a time budget and on the very video that reached the count for a video budget, so a budget
 * of five let four be watched. With it the hold waits for the video on screen to finish once,
 * and the feed's pager turns swipes down until then the way TikTok's own disable-scroll switch
 * does: the pager neither intercepts nor handles the gesture, and everything inside it (a tap,
 * a double tap, the seek bar, comments) still gets its touches.
 *
 * <p>The wait ends at the first of: the video completing, a different video coming up by any
 * route (TikTok's auto scroll, an accessibility scroll action, a detail page's own swipe), or
 * {@link #LONGEST_MS}. A missed completion therefore costs at most that long, and nothing that
 * moves the feed gets the reader past the budget: the next video arrives under the hold.
 *
 * <p>Only the main activity's pager is held. A video opened from messages, a profile or search
 * plays in TikTok's detail activity, which keeps its swipe; opening one is a video change like any
 * other, so it ends the wait and the hold treats that page the way it always has.
