 * Show the progress bar already rewrites, is only asked once this method has said yes.
 *
 * Two of the reasons are experiments rather than facts about the video. State 6 is an "inverse
 * experiment" that hides the bar on every video but paid content for whoever the server puts
 * in that group, which is how a bar can be there one day, gone the next and back after a
 * restart (issue #16: gone from the whole feed but present in the drama player, which plays
 * paid content). State 2, "can not drag", asks a second experiment and, without it, hides the
 * bar on any video the server did not flag as draggable. The gates themselves are renamed on
 * every build; the log lines are not, so each gate is found from its line.
