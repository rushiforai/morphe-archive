 * <p>Morphe patcher 1.14's `matchAll` narrows its search by instruction filters alone. Without one
 * it runs the fingerprint over every method of TikTok, whatever `definingClass` says, which cost
 * about half a second a fingerprint on a desktop and far more on a phone (#54). A single match does
 * use the suffix; this gives `matchAll` the same.

/**
 * The types of the classes holding a call to some method of one of [owners], each an exact type
 * (`Lpkg/Type;`).
 *
 * <p>The patcher keeps an index of which classes reference which types, and a fingerprint whose
 * one instruction filter is a call on such a type is matched against those classes alone. A scan
 * that has to read every call in TikTok can skip every other class: these classes are a superset
 * of the callers of any one method, so the scan that follows still reads each instruction and
 * finds what it found before, over a few hundred classes instead of every class of the app (#54).
 * Each lookup also walks the class list once, so this takes types, not type and name pairs,
 * which cost the browser guard about eighty lookups. Hushfeed's own injected calls go to the
 * extension, so a class that calls one of these only after an earlier patch ran is not a case
 * this has to cover.
