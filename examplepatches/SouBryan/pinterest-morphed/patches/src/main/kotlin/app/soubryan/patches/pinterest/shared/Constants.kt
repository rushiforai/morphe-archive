     * Pinterest app compatibility.
     *
     * The Pinterest APK is distributed by Google Play as an app bundle
     * (`base.apk + split_config.*`), so the preferred file type is APKM
     * (Morphe Manager will guide users to fetch a bundle from APKMirror or
     * export it from an installed copy with SAI / APKExport).
     *
     * Every target from 14.20.0 through 14.27.0 has been verified end-to-end:
     * all 12 patches apply cleanly (12/12) on the exact version code listed
     * below. The fingerprints are anchored on Gson `@SerializedName` values,
     * Pinterest-owned class names and stable Android SDK strings — they have
     * survived every Pinterest release in this range without any code change.
     *
     * Targets are ordered from newest to oldest. **14.25.0 is the recommended
     * daily-driver build** — it is the most-tested version end-to-end on the
     * developer's device (ad blocking, share-sanitiser, copy-link resolver).
     * The other releases apply cleanly but have received less runtime testing.
