 *
 * The Pinterest client marks a pin/story as an ad via `Pin.getIsPromoted()`
 * (mangled to `p()` or a single letter). Downstream code branches on this
 * boolean to:
 *
 *   * render the "Promoted" badge and click-out CTA
 *   * fire ad-impression tracking beacons
 *   * insert the pin into ad slots inside the home feed and search results
 *
 * Forcing every such getter to return `false` makes every rendered pin look
 * organic to the rest of the app, so no ad chrome is drawn, no ad beacons
 * are sent, and no click-out flow is triggered.
 *
 * The pins themselves still appear in the feed (we don't strip them out of
 * the underlying list), but they behave as regular content. A future patch
 * can also filter them out of the feed-loader response for a truly zero-ad
 * feed.
