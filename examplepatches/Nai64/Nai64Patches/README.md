## Patches

| Patch | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Ads Free Rewards** | Auto-claim rewarded ad rewards without watching ads. WARNING: Enabling No Ads alongside this patch will prevent rewards from being claimed. |
| **No Ads** | Blocks ads: interstitial, banner, app open, MREC. Each ad type can be toggled individually. WARNING: Enabling Ads Free Rewards alongside this patch will cause it to NOT work (No Ads takes priority). |
| **Pairip Application Redirect** | Changes AndroidManifest.xml to redirect Pairip's Application entry point to the real app's Application class, preventing Pairip from ever starting. Auto-discovers the real app class from Pairip's DEX if not specified manually. |
| **Spoof Play Store Install Source** | Makes the app think it was installed from Google Play Store. Recommended if the app has a Play Store license check. |
