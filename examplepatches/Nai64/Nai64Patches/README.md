## ðŸ“– Overview

Nai's Patches is a set of ready made patches built for the [Morphe](https://github.com/MorpheApp) patcher. Each patch targets a common annoyance found in modern Android games: rewarded ad walls, forced splash screens, license popups, root and integrity detection, and locked in app purchases.

> [!NOTE]
> Every patch is optional. Enable only what you need for a given game. Most patches work independently, and several can be combined for a cleaner experience.

The project is open source and community driven. New patches and fixes land through standard pull requests, and releases are produced automatically.

<a name="how-to-use"></a>
## ðŸ› ï¸ How to Use

1. Open your game APK in the Morphe patcher.
2. Browse the patch list and toggle the patches you want.
3. Expand a patch to review its options and adjust them.
4. Run the patch and install the rebuilt APK.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always keep a copy of the original APK. If a patched build misbehaves, you can fall back to the unmodified version and try a different combination of patches.

Most patches expose friendly dropdowns or toggles instead of raw text fields, so you rarely need to type anything by hand.

<a name="tips"></a>
## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- Start with a minimal set of patches, then add more only if needed. Smaller changes are easier to debug.
- If a game crashes after patching, disable the most recent patch you enabled and test again.
- Use the Patch version option in Ads Free Rewards to roll back to an older implementation when a newer game build stops working.
- Spoof Play Store Install Source can help with apps that restrict features to Play Store installs.
- Force Landscape or Portrait is great for games that ignore device rotation or feel wrong in one orientation.

> [!TIP]
> Keep the patcher log open while testing. Patches that find nothing simply report a warning and move on, so a clean log with no errors usually means the game just did not contain that code path.

---

<a name="warnings"></a>
## âš ï¸ Warnings

> [!WARNING]
> Patches marked Experimental, such as Pairip Bypass, Custom App Resolution and Skip Splash Screen, hook deeper into app internals. They may not work on every game and can cause crashes or visual glitches.

> [!CAUTION]
> Modifying applications can violate the terms of service of the games you patch. Use these patches only on apps you own, for personal and educational purposes. The authors are not responsible for bans, data loss or other consequences.

- Do not enable every patch at once. Over patching raises the chance of conflicts.
- Some anti cheat or strongly protected games detect tampering regardless of these patches.
- Always back up your save data before installing a patched build.

---

<a name="compatibility"></a>
## ðŸ“‹ Compatibility

- Targets Android games packaged as APK or XAPK.
- Requires the Morphe patcher and a Java runtime.
- Works best on standard Unity, native and ad SDK based games.
- Patch behavior depends on the exact game build. A patch that works today may need an option tweak after a game update.

> [!NOTE]
> Because each game is different, no single configuration fits all titles. Treat the patch list as a toolkit and tune it per app.
