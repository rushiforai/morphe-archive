# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**fluffy-patches** is a [Morphe Patches](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches) repository containing patches for multiple Android apps. Each app gets its own subdirectory under `patches/`. Patches are compiled into a `.mpp` (Morphe Patch Package) file consumed by Morphe Manager.

## Build Commands

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `ANDROID_HOME` | Path to Android SDK (required for `buildAndroid` task) |
| `GITHUB_ACTOR` | GitHub username for accessing Morphe's private Maven registry |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub personal access token with `read:packages` scope |

### Commands

```bash
# Build the patch package (.mpp file)
./gradlew :patches:buildAndroid

# Generate patches metadata JSON files (patches-list.json)
./gradlew :patches:generatePatchesList

# Full build (compiles all modules)
./gradlew build

# Clean build artifacts
./gradlew :patches:clean
```

Build output: `patches/build/libs/patches-{version}.mpp`

### Verifying the Build

```bash
ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Android/Sdk" GITHUB_ACTOR="$(gh api user --jq '.login')" GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" ./gradlew :patches:buildAndroid
```

## Testing

- All patch updates must be tested on an APK using the Morphe CLI before committing.
- Use `adb` commands to install and verify the patched APK on a device/emulator when available.
- Any scripts added to `scripts/` must also be tested against a real APK and verified via ADB.

## Architecture

### Module Layout

```
patches/src/main/kotlin/app/template/patches/
├── shared/Constants.kt        # Compatibility targets for all supported apps
└── <appname>/                 # One directory per target app
    ├── <category>/            # Logical grouping (e.g. playstore/, root/, misc/)
    │   └── SomePatch.kt
    └── ...
extensions/extension/          # Java extensions for complex runtime logic (template, not actively used)
```

Each app's patches live in their own subdirectory. Add a new `Compatibility` constant in `shared/Constants.kt` when adding support for a new app.

### Patch Types

**Bytecode patches** (`bytecodePatch`) locate classes by smali name (`Lcom/package/ClassName;`), find methods, and inject/replace Dalvik instructions:

```kotlin
val myPatch = bytecodePatch(name = "...", description = "...") {
    compatibleWith(MY_APP_TARGET)
    execute {
        classDefBy("Lcom/package/ClassName;")
            .methods.first { it.name == "methodName" }
            .toMutable()
            .addInstructions(0, "const/4 v0, 0x0\nreturn v0")
    }
}
```

**Resource patches** (`resourcePatch`) modify XML files (AndroidManifest.xml, network config, etc.) via DOM manipulation.

Patches can declare `dependsOn(otherPatch)` to compose behaviors.

### Adding a New App

1. Add a `Compatibility(...)` constant in `shared/Constants.kt` with the app's package name, APK type, and icon color.
2. Create `patches/<appname>/` with patch files grouped by category.
3. Create `docs/<appname>/` and document initial APK analysis.
4. Reference the new constant in each patch's `compatibleWith(...)` call.
5. Run `./gradlew :patches:generatePatchesList` to regenerate metadata.

## APK Analysis with JADX CLI

Use JADX CLI to decompile and analyze target APKs before writing patches:

```bash
# Full decompilation with deobfuscation
jadx app.apk -d jadx_output --deobf

# Search for a class in decompiled output
find jadx_output/ -name "*.java" | xargs grep -l "ClassName"

# Search for a method call
find jadx_output/ -name "*.java" | xargs grep -n "methodName("

# Search for a string literal
find jadx_output/ -name "*.java" | xargs grep -l "string to find"

# Get AndroidManifest.xml
cat jadx_output/resources/AndroidManifest.xml

# Find all classes in a package
find jadx_output/ -path "*/com/example/*" -name "*.java"
```

Always verify class/method existence in the target APK before writing patches.

## Available Skills

This project includes agent skills loaded on-demand via the `skill` tool. Use these when the task matches their description:

| Skill | Description | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `morphe-patching` | Create, edit, and debug Morphe patches | Writing new patches, fixing broken patches, smali injection |
| `android-apk-analysis` | Analyze Android APK structure, decompile with JADX | Reverse-engineering APKs, finding patch targets |
| `revanced-to-morphe` | Convert ReVanced patches to Morphe patches | Migrating from ReVanced, adapting patching techniques |
| `openspec-explore` | Think through ideas and clarify requirements | Exploring ideas before or during a change |
| `openspec-propose` | Propose a new change with design, specs, and tasks | Quickly describing what to build |
| `openspec-apply-change` | Implement tasks from an OpenSpec change | Starting or continuing implementation |
| `openspec-archive-change` | Archive a completed change | Finalizing after implementation is done |

To use a skill, invoke it with the `skill` tool. The full instructions will be loaded automatically.

## Documentation

All knowledge, findings, and debugging notes must be documented under `docs/<appname>/` with category-based folders and files. Examples:

- `docs/jiotv-mobile/research/ssl-pinning.md` — SSL pinning analysis
- `docs/jiotv-mobile/research/emulator-root-detection.md` — Detection mechanisms researched
- `docs/jiotv-mobile/debugging-journey.md` — Step-by-step debugging notes

Create new markdown files as you discover:
- How a detection mechanism works (classes, methods, strings)
- Failed patch attempts and why they failed
- Smali patterns and Dalvik instruction findings
- APK structure observations
- Any useful context for future contributors

### Patch Metadata

`PatchListGenerator` (in `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/morphe/util/`) reads compiled patch classes and generates `patches-list.json`. This runs automatically as part of `generatePatchesList`.

## Release Process

Releases are fully automated via semantic-release on push to `main` or `dev` branches:
- `main` → stable release
- `dev` → pre-release
- After release, `main` is auto-backmerged into `dev`

Use conventional commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`.

Version is stored in `gradle.properties` and updated automatically by CI.
