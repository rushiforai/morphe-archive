/**
 * Credentials the patched AdMobile signs its AdMob API calls with.
 *
 * <p>AdMobile obtains an authorization code through Google Sign-In, exchanges it for tokens at
 * {@code oauth2.googleapis.com/token}, and downloads the OAuth client secret from the developer's
 * Firestore once Firebase has accepted the sign-in. A re-signed APK cannot complete Google Sign-In,
 * which leaves every step after it without inputs.
 *
 * <p>Everything after the authorization code is plain HTTPS that does not care how the APK is
 * signed, so supplying the client and a refresh token directly is enough. The patch redirects the
 * app's reads of the client id, client secret, publisher id and refresh token here.
 *
 * <p>Values live in the app's own private preferences and are entered in {@link
 * CredentialsActivity}. Nothing is compiled into the APK, so a patched build carries no secret and
 * one build works for everybody.
