# TikTok Patches for Morphe

<br>

**This repository is a Morphe patch source for TikTok.**

**It continues the work from earlier community TikTok patch sets, including ReVanced, with the patches adapted for Morphe and tested against newer TikTok builds. The current target is the global TikTok package, `com.zhiliaoapp.musically`, on [TikTok `43.8.3`](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/tiktok-pte-ltd/tik-tok-including-musical-ly/tiktok-43-8-3-release/tiktok-43-8-3-2-android-apk-download/).**

The goal is to keep the existing patch set usable while adding more TikTok-focused features over time. Some features are small fixes, some are quality-of-life changes, and some need deeper testing because TikTok changes its internals often.

<br>

## Available Patches

- `Settings`: Adds the Morphe settings screen inside TikTok.
- `Enable Open Debug`: Uses TikTok's hidden Open Debug settings cell as the entry point for Morphe settings.
- `Disable login requirement`: Lets supported TikTok flows load without the normal login wall first.
- `Fix Google login`: Restores Google sign-in behavior after patching.
- `Feed filter`: Filters feed items such as ads, livestreams, stories, shop content, image videos, and videos outside configured view or like ranges.
- `Feed tab navigation`: Adds controls for choosing which loaded top and bottom feed tabs stay visible, with an option to block tabs TikTok adds later.
- `Downloads`: Adds download-related controls.
  - Downloads videos without watermark.
  - Downloads images without watermark.
  - Saves comment sticker videos/images to the device gallery.
  - Lets you choose a relative internal-storage download folder with a simple browse helper.
  - Adds an optional custom offline video limit entry, configurable up to 500 videos.
- `Playback speed`: Adds playback speed controls.
- `Remember clear display`: Keeps the clear-display state across videos.
- `SIM spoof`: Spoofs SIM-related values used by TikTok region logic, with popular country/operator presets for easier setup. TikTok may still use other region signals such as IP, account history, and language.
- `Sanitize sharing links`: Cleans TikTok share links before they leave the app.
- `Copy comments without username`: Copies only the comment text when using TikTok's copy comment action.
- `Auto Translate comments`: Automatically translates loaded and expanded comment batches using TikTok's translation system, while skipping comments that already match the device language when TikTok exposes that language clearly.
- `Show seekbar`: Shows the video seekbar where TikTok would normally hide it.

## Planned Work

### In Progress

- [~] Drama mini series feed video filter

### Planned

- [ ] Add comments section sorting options


<br>

## Supported Target

- App: TikTok
- Version: [`43.8.3`](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/tiktok-pte-ltd/tik-tok/tiktok-43-8-3-2-release/tiktok-43-8-3-4-android-apk-download/)
- Package: `com.zhiliaoapp.musically`

Only the global package is declared in Morphe compatibility metadata. The JP package may share some internals, but it is not advertised as supported unless it gets its own proof pass again.

## Building

Build the Morphe patch bundle and metadata:

```bash
./gradlew :patches:buildAndroid :patches:generatePatchesList
```

The generated bundle is written to:

```text
patches/build/libs/patches-<version>.mpp
```

Morphe reads `patches-bundle.json` from this repository, downloads the `.mpp` release asset listed there, and loads the patch metadata from that bundle.

<br>

## Project Structure

- `patches/`: Kotlin patch definitions, fingerprints, and shared patch utilities.
- `extensions/`: Java extension code injected into TikTok by the patches.
- `patches-list.json`: Generated patch metadata.
- `patches-bundle.json`: Morphe source metadata for the published release bundle.

## Notes

- The source is based on [RookieEnough/De-Vanced](https://github.com/RookieEnough/De-Vanced) and the [Morphe patches template](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches-template).
- It is not affiliated with TikTok, ByteDance, or Morphe.
- TikTok changes often, so compatibility is intentionally tied to the exact version and packages listed above.
