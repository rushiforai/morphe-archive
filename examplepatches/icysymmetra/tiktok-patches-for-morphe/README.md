# Metra TikTok Patches

<br>

**This repository is a Morphe patch source for TikTok.**

**It continues the work from earlier community TikTok patch sets, including ReVanced, with the patches adapted for Morphe and tested against newer TikTok builds. The current target is the global TikTok package, `com.zhiliaoapp.musically`, on [TikTok `46.2.3`](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/tiktok-pte-ltd/tik-tok-including-musical-ly/tiktok-46-2-3-release/tiktok-46-2-3-android-apk-download/).**

The goal is to keep the existing patch set usable while adding more TikTok-focused features over time. Some features are small fixes, some are quality-of-life changes, and some need deeper testing because TikTok changes its internals often.

<br>

## Available Patches

| Patch | Description |
|---|---|
| `Always show publish date` | Keeps the video's publish date visible in its author information. |
| `Copy comments without username` | Copies only the comment text without including the creator's username. |
| `Custom offline videos limit` | Adds a custom entry to TikTok's offline videos menu with a configurable limit from 1 to 1000 videos. Values outside the range use the nearest valid limit. |
| `Disable login requirement` | Removes TikTok's mandatory login gate from supported flows. |
| `Disable long-press quick share` | Keeps long-pressing Share from opening TikTok's quick-share interaction. |
| `Disable long-press repost` | Keeps holding Like from opening TikTok's repost action without disabling TikTok's wider repost and upvote systems. |
| `Disable screen capture detection` | Disables capture detection and secure-window screenshot protection, including Circle to Search blocking. |
| `Diagnostic tools` | Adds optional structured Morphe logs, TikTok crash capture, clipboard or file report export, and a rolling [feed debugger](docs/feed-controls-and-debugging.md). |
| `Downloads` | Adds watermark-free downloads, separate media destinations, filename templates, video quality selection, and comment sticker saving with animated-media preservation. |
| `Enable Live search` | Shows TikTok's search entry in the Live drawer where supported. |
| `Enable non-personalized search` | Uses TikTok's non-personalized search mode instead of its saved account choice. |
| `Enable voice comments` | Enables TikTok's native voice-message controls in video comment sections when the account and server support them. |
| `Feature Gate Lab` | Adds a searchable menu for viewing and overriding supported TikTok feature flags and configuration values. Client-side overrides cannot bypass server enforcement. |
| `Feed filter` | Hides feed ads, TikTok Shop items, livestreams, stories, photo posts, and videos outside configured view or like ranges. |
| `Feed tab navigation` | Controls which loaded top and bottom navigation tabs remain visible, blocks newly added tabs when requested, and can hide the Tako AI bubble. |
| `Fix Google login` | Restores Google account sign-in after patching. |
| `Foldable split comment view` | Forces TikTok's tablet-style split layout, showing comments beside the video instead of as a bottom sheet, once the screen is at least as wide as a configurable threshold (600dp by default). Intended for foldables TikTok doesn't already treat as tablet-class. |
| `Force show Auto scroll` | Adds a setting that bypasses TikTok's rollout gates for its native Auto scroll action on supported videos. |
| `Hide AI content` | Hides posts marked as AI-generated or AI-modified by TikTok or their creators. Unmarked AI content may still appear. |
| `Hide CAPTCHA popups` | Hides non-account verification puzzle dialogs, including those shown while browsing LIVE. Account verification remains available, and server checks are not bypassed. |
| `Hide floating promotions` | Removes floating promotional badges, coin icons, and timer banners from the Home feed. |
| `Hide feed follow button` | Adds an option to hide the + follow button below creator avatars in video feeds. |
| `Hide feed LIVE button` | Adds an option to hide the LIVE button at the top left of video feeds. |
| `Hide feed save button` | Adds an option to hide the save/favourites button from video feeds. |
| `Hide feed search button` | Adds an option to hide the search button at the top right of video feeds. |
| `Hide FYP unpersonalized slop videos` | Hides certain batches of unpersonalized slop posts that appear in your For You feed. |
| `Hide quick comment reactions` | Hides TikTok's exposed quick emoji row in supported comment inputs. |
| `Hide suggested accounts` | Removes suggested-account cards from profile and inbox surfaces. |
| `Hold-and-slide 2x lock` | Enables TikTok's native hold, slide down, and release gesture for locking playback at 2x speed. |
| `Open external links directly` | Opens profile and story website links in the system browser instead of TikTok's in-app browser. |
| `Playback speed` | Enables playback-speed controls for all videos and remembers the selected speed between videos. |
| `Remember clear display` | Remembers TikTok's clear-display state between videos. |
| `Resume videos after scrolling` | Restores a video's prior playback position when returning to it in the feed. |
| `Region spoof` | Adds in-app controls for changing the region identity values TikTok reads. TikTok may still use IP address, account history, language, and other region signals. |
| `Sanitize sharing links` | Removes tracking parameters from TikTok links before they are shared. |
| `Settings` | Adds the Metra patches settings screen inside TikTok. |
| `Share sheet modification` | Toggles the share sheet's "Send to", "Share via app", and "Video Actions" sections, with an allow-list for which apps and actions appear in the latter two. |
| `Show seekbar` | Shows TikTok's native video seekbar where it would normally be hidden. |
| `Show seekbar thumbnail` | Shows TikTok's video preview thumbnail while dragging the seekbar. |
| `Stop video looping` | Stops a completed video instead of automatically replaying it. |
| `Translate comments` | Adds comment translation controls using TikTok's translation system, with selectable language exclusions. |

## Regional Restrictions

Region spoofing changes the country, SIM, carrier, and related region details that TikTok reads from the app, so it can help with client-side region checks and onboarding. It cannot hide the public IP address that TikTok's servers see from the connection, so it cannot replace a VPN or proxy in a country where TikTok blocks service by IP. The regional popup can be hidden, but that only removes the warning and does not turn a rejected feed request into a successful one. TikTok may also keep a blocked network state for a while after a VPN is disconnected, in which case force-stopping TikTok and clearing its cache can be required before the feed recovers.

<br>

## Planned Work

Open to feature requests.

<br>

## Supported Target

- App: TikTok
- Version: [`46.2.3`](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/tiktok-pte-ltd/tik-tok-including-musical-ly/tiktok-46-2-3-release/tiktok-46-2-3-android-apk-download/)
- Package: `com.zhiliaoapp.musically`

Only the global package is declared in Morphe compatibility metadata. The JP package may share some internals, but it is not advertised as supported unless it gets its own proof pass again.

## Building

Build the Morphe patch bundle and metadata:

```bash
./gradlew :patches:buildAndroid :patches:generatePatchesList
```

The generated bundle is written to:

```text
patches/build/libs/patches-<version>.mpp
```

Morphe reads `patches-bundle.json` from this repository, downloads the `.mpp` release asset listed there, and loads the patch metadata from that bundle.

<br>

## Project Structure

- `patches/`: Kotlin patch definitions, fingerprints, and shared patch utilities.
- `extensions/`: Java extension code injected into TikTok by the patches.
- `patches-list.json`: Generated patch metadata.
- `patches-bundle.json`: Morphe source metadata for the published release bundle.
