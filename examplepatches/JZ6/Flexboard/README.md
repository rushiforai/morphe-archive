</p>

Or add the repository URL by hand as a patch source in Morphe:
`https://github.com/JZ6/Flexboard`

Patch Gboard from that source in Morphe and install the result. The patched build installs as a
separate app rather than replacing the Gboard you already have, so once it is on the device:

1. Enable the **Patched Gboard** in Android's on-screen keyboard settings.
2. Switch to it with the keyboard picker.

Both keyboards stay installed, so you can switch back whenever you like.

| :---: |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Bigger Toolbar](#bigger-toolbar) | Raises how many icons Gboard's toolbar can hold — five on a stock build — to 12, so Flexboard's hotkeys and text action buttons fit alongside Gboard's own. How many actually show stays yours, set by dragging them in Gboard's toolbar settings. Force-stop Gboard afterwards: a cached keyboard view can go on showing the old capacity. |  |
| [Bypass Gboard Signature](#bypass-gboard-signature) | Bypass Gboard's signature whitelist checks and force them to pass. |  |
| Grammar Check Row | Force the grammar check settings row to appear. The Phenotype flag that governs it never syncs on a patched build, so its compiled-in default (off) sticks. |  |
| [Install as Gboard Clone](#install-as-gboard-clone) | Rename the package to dev.jz6.com.google.android.inputmethod.latin so the patched build installs alongside the official Gboard instead of replacing it. |  |
| Suggested Settings | Turns on flick keys for symbols, touch & hold keys for numbers, suggestion strip, grammar check and smart replies, and turns off block offensive words and word suggestions. Written once as defaults, so each can still be changed in Gboard's own settings. |  |
| [Swipe Left to Delete](#swipe-left-to-delete) | Swipe left anywhere on the keyboard to delete the previous word, and swipe right to restore it. Uses Gboard's own word-scrub engine, so it behaves exactly like swiping on the backspace key already does — only it can start anywhere. |  |
| [Swipe Right to Undo](#swipe-right-to-undo) | Swipe right after deleting to put the words back — the swipe starts on the Delete key, or anywhere when Swipe Left to Delete is also applied. Uses Gboard's own undo, which already records what a delete swipe removed. |  |
| [Text Action Buttons](#text-action-buttons) | Add Select all, Copy and Paste buttons to the toolbar above the keyboard, so each is one tap instead of opening Gboard's text editing panel first. Registered natively, so drag-to-reorder through the toolbar customize page persists. These three compete for the five icons Gboard's toolbar holds; Bigger Toolbar raises that ceiling if you run the hotkeys as well. |  |
| [Toolbar Hotkeys](#toolbar-hotkeys) | Adds six configurable hotkey slots to Gboard's toolbar — each commits a text of your choice on tap. A slot appears when its text is set; when cleared it hides at the next toolbar rebuild (rotate, switch IME, or restart — there's no mid-session un-register). Text and icon edits apply on the next keyboard open. Gboard's toolbar holds five icons in total, shared with its own, so apply Bigger Toolbar too if you want all six on the bar at once. |  |
| Vibration Slider Everywhere | Forces Gboard to show its own vibration strength slider on every device, rather than deferring to the system haptic settings page, so the strength is adjustable instead of being fixed by whichever rollout the device landed in. |  |

## Swipe left to delete

Flexboard does not add a gesture. Gboard already has one — swiping on the backspace key deletes the
previous word — and everything about it, including dragging back to restore, works across the whole
keyboard once started. The only thing keeping it to the backspace key is a single check on which key
your finger landed on. Flexboard removes that check for the delete gesture, and leaves the spacebar
cursor-drag alone.

So the feel, the thresholds and the restore behaviour are all Gboard's own.

It also changes two of Gboard's settings at startup, because the gesture cannot work otherwise:

| Setting | Set to | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Glide delete** | on | The gesture is Gboard's; with this off it is never attached at all |
| **Glide typing** | off | A leftward drag across the letters is also a glide input, so the two cannot both be live |

Both are in Gboard's **Glide typing** screen, and because both are written on every start, both are
**greyed out** while the gesture is on — otherwise changing either would appear to work and quietly
revert at the next start. The switch that hands them back sits directly above them in that same
screen, so the way out is where the problem is. It is the same setting as the switch on Flexboard's
own screen, not a copy.

Removing Flexboard leaves glide typing off — tick it back on in Gboard's own settings.

## Settings

Gboard's settings gain a **Flexboard** entry that opens a screen of sliders. Three of them shape
the swipe-anywhere gesture; the backspace key keeps Gboard's own behaviour, see below.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Max words per swipe** | 1 | The most words one swipe can delete. At 1 a swipe deletes a single word however far it travels; 10 means no limit. Swiping back still restores. |

Swipe length and hold delay are fixed rather than adjustable. The swipe travels Gboard's own
distance per word, and deleting starts immediately instead of after Gboard's 200 ms press-and-hold.
Both were sliders once; [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md) has why they are not now.

The screen also carries six **Hotkeys** fields belonging to
[Text Action Buttons](#text-action-buttons).

Every value is read out of Gboard's own preference store, so there is no separate settings app and
nothing to keep in sync.

The starting values are written into the store the first time the patched app runs, rather than
being numbers inside the patch. So they behave as defaults for a fresh install, and a later update
can pick different ones without moving settings you have already got used to.

Changes are not instant: a new setting is picked up the next time the keyboard is opened. Hotkeys
are half an exception — *editing* a snippet takes effect immediately, because the text is read when
the button is tapped, but its name on the toolbar and whether the button exists at all are decided
when the bar is built.

Each section appears only if you ticked the patch it belongs to. The patches register the sections
they own while they run, and the settings screen keeps just those — so there are no rows for
features that are not in your build.

### The backspace key still behaves the way Gboard built it

The sliders above apply to swipes that start **anywhere on the letters**. A swipe that starts on the
**backspace key** — the one place Gboard's own word-delete has always worked — keeps Gboard's
distance per word and is not capped, so it still deletes as many words as you drag across.

That is deliberate. A one-word cap and a short swipe are right for a gesture you trigger by accident
sometimes; they are wrong for the deliberate press-and-drag on backspace that people already have
muscle memory for. Flexboard adds a gesture rather than replacing one.

It works because Gboard keeps the key a gesture started on for the gesture's whole life, so the
engine can still tell the two apart even though Flexboard widened the gate that used to distinguish
them. The derivation is in [`docs/motion-event-handlers.md`](docs/motion-event-handlers.md).

Hold delay is the exception: it is decided before a gesture activates, and is shared. At the default
of 0 ms neither swipe has a hold.

### There is no on/off switch, and that is deliberate

Flexboard used to carry a master switch, and a separate one for undo. Both are gone. **Untick the
patch in Morphe instead** — that is the off switch.

They were removed because of what they cost rather than what they did. Reading a preference from
patched bytecode means finding registers that are provably dead at the point the read is inserted,
and R8 re-runs register allocation on every Gboard release — so each switch was a fresh derivation
to redo, and a fresh chance to get one wrong, every single version bump. Between them the two
switches accounted for most of the work in the 17.7.7 → 18.0.3 port. The sliders stay because their
values genuinely vary by thumb and screen; an on/off switch duplicates something Morphe already
does properly.

**One consequence is user-visible: glide typing is off for as long as Swipe Left to Delete is applied.**
A leftward drag across the letters is also a glide input, so the two cannot both be live. Flexboard
forces glide typing off at every app start and greys out the two affected rows in Gboard's **Glide
typing** screen, with a note saying what is doing it. Getting glide typing back means re-patching
without Swipe Left to Delete.

## Swipe right to undo

Swiping right *during* a delete puts the words back — that is Gboard's own behaviour, and it stops
the moment you lift your finger. Swiping right **after** you have lifted now undoes the delete too.

Two limits worth knowing, both inherited rather than chosen:

- **It only works as the very next thing you do.** Gboard keeps one deleted phrase and clears it on
  almost any other input, so typing a character after the delete loses the undo.
- **One level.** Undo once and the slot is empty; a second right-swipe does nothing.

It is always on when the patch is applied. Swiping right after a delete did nothing at all in stock
Gboard, so nothing is being taken away by giving it a meaning — and Gboard fills the same undo slot
when you swipe on the backspace key, so it works there too.

## Text action buttons

Adds **Select all**, **Copy** and **Paste** buttons to the toolbar above the keyboard. One tap
each, on whatever you are typing into.

Gboard can already do all three, behind its **Text editing** toolbar button — open that panel, then
tap the one you want. These are the same actions without the panel.

They take the first three slots on the toolbar, which pushes whatever used to be last into the
overflow menu behind the chevron. Long-press the toolbar to reorder them like any other button.

The labels are Gboard's own, so they are already translated wherever Gboard is. The icons are
Material's — the select-all marquee, and the familiar copy and paste marks. Gboard ships all three
and draws none of them, because its text editing panel spells the actions out in words rather than
using icons; that is why Select all first shipped borrowing an unrelated icon. Flexboard still adds
no images of its own.

## Toolbar hotkeys

Six more toolbar buttons, each typing a string you set under **Hotkeys** in Flexboard's settings —
an email address, a signature, "brb", whatever you type often enough to resent typing.

**A slot you have not filled in makes no button.** Fresh out of the box there are no hotkeys at all;
fill one in and its icon appears on the toolbar, clear the field and the button goes away again.
That is the on/off switch, and it is per-button.

Each button is named by your own text, so they are easy to tell apart when you long-press to
reorder the toolbar. On the bar itself there is only room for the icon, and here the icons are
arbitrary — a star, a sparkle, scissors, a ticked box, a ring, a share mark. They have to be:
Gboard bundles 29 Material shapes and not one of them is a digit, and Flexboard ships no images of
its own. So the settings screen draws each slot's real icon beside the field that fills it, which
is the moment you actually need to know which is which.

Long text is fine. The whole of it gets typed; only the first line, cut short, becomes the name.

**Nine buttons is more than the bar holds** — unless *Bigger toolbar* is applied, which is what it
is for. Without it, the three text actions plus a few hotkeys push whatever used to sit at the end
of your toolbar into the overflow menu behind the chevron. Long-press the toolbar to reorder, and
drop what you do not need.

## Bigger toolbar

Gboard's toolbar holds five icons. Flexboard adds nine of its own — six hotkeys and three text
actions — and those nine compete with the emoji, clipboard and settings buttons already there. So
the bar is the limit on everything above, and this patch raises it to twelve.

**It does not decide how many you see.** Choosing what sits on the bar is Gboard's own job, done by
long-pressing the toolbar and dragging icons in or out, and this patch does not touch it. All it
changes is the ceiling that choice runs into. Take a button off and it stays off; the count is
yours.

That distinction is the whole patch, and it is the part two earlier attempts got wrong. Both tried
to set the number of icons themselves, and both ended up fighting the toolbar customise screen —
one of them putting buttons back after they had been removed. Gboard treats *"take this off the
bar"* as lowering the count, so anything that forces the count up undoes the removal. Raising only
the ceiling cannot do that.

Two things worth knowing. Twelve icons on a phone are narrow — the bar divides the width it has
rather than scrolling — so twelve is the room available, not a recommendation. And if you had
already trimmed your toolbar before applying this, you will still see your old number until you
drag more icons onto the bar, because that number is your setting and the patch leaves it alone.

## Flick keys for symbols

Gboard can already enter a key's hinted symbol when you pull down on it — **Flick keys to enter
symbols**, in its Preferences screen — and ships it off. Flexboard turns it on.

It is written **once**, only if you have never set it, so it behaves as a default rather than
something forced: turn it off in Gboard's settings and it stays off.

One quirk worth knowing. Gboard's own settings row for it depends on **Touch & hold keys for
numbers**, so while that is off the flick row shows as on but greyed out — the feature works, you
just cannot toggle it from there. Enabling "Touch & hold keys for numbers" un-greys it. Flexboard
deliberately does not change that setting for you, since nothing at runtime needs it.

## Install as Gboard clone

Renames the package so the patched build installs beside the official Gboard rather than replacing
it. Both keyboards stay in the picker, which is why the install steps above end with enabling and
choosing the new one.

Untick it and the patched build replaces the Gboard you already have.

## Bypass Gboard signature

Gboard hashes its own signing certificate and compares it against a list baked into the app. A
patched build is re-signed, so that check fails. Flexboard forces it to pass.

Nothing about this one is visible either way, and it turns out that nothing is behind it. The
check gates no feature: its only real caller does nothing except the check itself, and throws if
it fails. Patched **without** this one the keyboard still opens — the exception lands on a
background thread during startup and everything carries on. So it removes a startup crash rather
than restoring anything.

It is kept anyway, because an exception on every cold start is worth silencing even when it is
survivable, and because assuming it stays harmless on every device is a worse bet than simply
patching it out.
