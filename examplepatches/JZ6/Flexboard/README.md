  </a>
</p>

Or add the repository URL by hand as a patch source in Morphe:
`https://github.com/JZ6/Flexboard`

Patch Gboard from that source in Morphe and install the result. The patched build installs as a
separate app rather than replacing the Gboard you already have, so once it is on the device:

1. Enable the **Patched Gboard** in Android's on-screen keyboard settings.
2. Switch to it with the keyboard picker.

Both keyboards stay installed, so you can switch back whenever you like.

| :---: |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Bigger Toolbar](#bigger-toolbar) | Raises how many icons Gboard's toolbar can hold — five on a stock build — to 12, so Flexboard's hotkeys and text action buttons fit alongside Gboard's own. How many actually show stays yours, set by dragging them in Gboard's toolbar settings. Force-stop Gboard afterwards: a cached keyboard view can go on showing the old capacity. |  |
| [Bypass Gboard Signature](#bypass-gboard-signature) | Bypass Gboard's own startup signature check without changing other callers. |  |
| [Crash reporter (debug)](#crash-reporter-debug) | For debugging. After a keyboard crash, the error is saved and copied to your clipboard the next time the keyboard starts, so it can be pasted into a bug report. This replaces whatever was on the clipboard. Off by default. |  |
| [Enable Rambler](#enable-rambler) | Exposes Google Rambler — Gboard's agentic dictation, which rewrites what you say into composed text — as a choice in Voice settings. It is not switched on for you: the feature uses a Google server, has its own quota and asks for consent, so picking it is left to you. |  |
| [Hidden Features](#hidden-features) | Turns on two finished Gboard features that a resigned build can never receive: grammar check, and a close control on the chips Gboard offers unprompted. Their flags are delivered per app signature, so resigning the APK means they never arrive and stay off. Both are confirmed working on a device; five other flags were tried and dropped. |  |
| [Install as Gboard Clone](#install-as-gboard-clone) | Rename the package to dev.jz6.com.google.android.inputmethod.latin so the patched build installs alongside the official Gboard instead of replacing it. |  |
| [Modern keypress haptics](#modern-keypress-haptics) | Uses Android's haptic primitives for keypresses — the crisp tick the rest of the system uses — instead of a plain buzz. Gboard has the code and disables it with an impossible minimum Android version; this removes that. Devices whose vibrator cannot do primitives are unaffected, because Gboard's own hardware check still runs. Note that it changes what the vibration strength slider means, from milliseconds to intensity. |  |
| [Suggested Settings](#suggested-settings) | Turns on flick keys for symbols, touch & hold keys for numbers, suggestion strip, grammar check and smart replies, and turns off block offensive words and word suggestions. Written once as defaults, so each can still be changed in Gboard's own settings. Grammar check is the switch, not the feature: the row only exists on a resigned build if Hidden Features is applied too. |  |
| [Swipe Left to Delete](#swipe-left-to-delete) | Swipe left anywhere on the keyboard to delete the previous word, and swipe right to restore it. Uses Gboard's word-scrub engine; anywhere swipes have a one-word default cap, while deliberate backspace swipes keep Gboard's uncapped behaviour. |  |
| [Swipe Right to Undo](#swipe-right-to-undo) | Swipe right after deleting to put the words back — the swipe starts on the Delete key, or anywhere when Swipe Left to Delete is also applied. Uses Gboard's own undo, which already records what a delete swipe removed. |  |
| [Swipe up to undo autocorrect](#swipe-up-to-undo-autocorrect) | Swipe up on the keyboard to undo the last autocorrection: the word you typed comes back, as with Gboard's own undo autocorrect on backspace. It works right after the correction, before you type anything else; otherwise the swipe does nothing. The key you swiped on is not typed. |  |
| [Text Action Buttons](#text-action-buttons) | Add Select all, Copy and Paste buttons to the toolbar above the keyboard, so each is one tap instead of opening Gboard's text editing panel first. Registered natively, so drag-to-reorder through the toolbar customize page persists. These three share the toolbar with Gboard's own icons and with Toolbar Hotkeys. Bigger Toolbar, which is applied unless you deselect it, raises the ceiling from five to twelve; without it, five is all the bar can hold. |  |
| [Toolbar Hotkeys](#toolbar-hotkeys) | Adds eight configurable hotkey slots to Gboard's toolbar — each commits a text of your choice on tap. A slot appears when its text is set; when cleared it hides at the next toolbar rebuild (rotate, switch IME, or restart — there's no mid-session un-register). Text and icon edits apply on the next keyboard open. The slots share the toolbar with Gboard's own icons: Bigger Toolbar, which is applied unless you deselect it, makes room for twelve, but on a stock ceiling of five not all eight fit. |  |
| [Vibration Slider Everywhere](#vibration-slider-everywhere) | Forces Gboard to show its own vibration strength slider on every device, rather than deferring to the system haptic settings page, so the strength is adjustable instead of being fixed by whichever rollout the device landed in. |  |

<!-- PATCHES_END -->

Each has its own section below, and each can be unticked in Morphe if you would rather it were never
installed.

## Swipe left to delete

Flexboard does not add a gesture. Gboard already has one — swiping on the backspace key deletes the
previous word — and everything about it, including dragging back to restore, works across the whole
keyboard once started. The only thing keeping it to the backspace key is a single check on which key
your finger landed on. Flexboard removes that check for the delete gesture, and leaves the spacebar
cursor-drag alone.

So the feel, the thresholds and the restore behaviour are all Gboard's own.

It also changes two of Gboard's settings at startup, because the gesture cannot work otherwise:

| Setting | Set to | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Glide delete** | on | The gesture is Gboard's; with this off it is never attached at all |
| **Glide typing** | off | A leftward drag across the letters is also a glide input, so the two cannot both be live |

Both are in Gboard's **Glide typing** screen, and because both are written on every start, both are
**greyed out** while the gesture is on — otherwise changing either would appear to work and quietly
revert at the next start. A non-selectable **Managed by Flexboard** note sits above the rows. To
restore glide typing, re-patch without Swipe Left to Delete, then turn glide typing back on.

Removing Flexboard leaves glide typing off — tick it back on in Gboard's own settings.

## Settings

Gboard's settings gain a **Flexboard** entry with one slider, hotkey editors and an About section.
The slider shapes the swipe-anywhere gesture; the backspace key keeps Gboard's own behaviour.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Max words per swipe** | 1 | The most words one swipe can delete. At 1 a swipe deletes a single word however far it travels; 10 means no limit. Swiping back still restores. |

Swipe length and hold delay have no controls. The swipe travels Gboard's own distance per word.
On a fresh install, deleting starts immediately instead of after Gboard's 200 ms press-and-hold;
an older stored hold-delay value still applies until that preference is cleared. Both were sliders
once; [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md) has why they are not now.

The screen also carries eight **Hotkeys** editor rows belonging to
[Toolbar Hotkeys](#toolbar-hotkeys).

Every value is read out of Gboard's own preference store, so there is no separate settings app and
nothing to keep in sync.

The slider reads a default from the patch unless you set a value in the store. Suggested Settings
seeds Gboard preferences individually when unset, so later updates can add a new default without
overwriting values you chose.

Changes are not instant: a new setting is picked up the next time the keyboard is opened. Hotkeys
are half an exception — *editing* a snippet takes effect immediately, because the text is read when
the button is tapped, but its name on the toolbar and whether the button exists at all are decided
when the bar is built.

Each section appears only if you ticked the patch it belongs to. The patches register the sections
they own while they run, and the settings screen keeps just those — so there are no rows for
features that are not in your build.

### The backspace key still behaves the way Gboard built it

The word-cap slider above applies to swipes that start **anywhere on the letters**. A swipe that starts on the
**backspace key** — the one place Gboard's own word-delete has always worked — keeps Gboard's
distance per word and is not capped, so it still deletes as many words as you drag across.

That is deliberate. A one-word cap is right for a gesture you trigger by accident sometimes;
it is wrong for the deliberate press-and-drag on backspace that people already have
muscle memory for. Flexboard adds a gesture rather than replacing one.

It works because Gboard keeps the key a gesture started on for the gesture's whole life, so the
engine can still tell the two apart even though Flexboard widened the gate that used to distinguish
them. The derivation is in [`docs/motion-event-handlers.md`](docs/motion-event-handlers.md).

Hold delay is the exception: it is decided before a gesture activates, and is shared. At the default
of 0 ms neither swipe has a hold.

### There is no on/off switch, and that is deliberate

Flexboard used to carry a master switch, and a separate one for undo. Both are gone. **Untick the
patch in Morphe instead** — that is the off switch.

They were removed because of what they cost rather than what they did. Reading a preference from
patched bytecode means finding registers that are provably dead at the point the read is inserted,
and R8 re-runs register allocation on every Gboard release — so each switch was a fresh derivation
to redo, and a fresh chance to get one wrong, every single version bump. Between them the two
switches accounted for most of the work in the 17.7.7 → 18.0.3 port. The sliders stay because their
values genuinely vary by thumb and screen; an on/off switch duplicates something Morphe already
does properly.

**One consequence is user-visible: glide typing is off for as long as Swipe Left to Delete is applied.**
A leftward drag across the letters is also a glide input, so the two cannot both be live. Flexboard
forces glide typing off at every app start and greys out the two affected rows in Gboard's **Glide
typing** screen, with a note saying what is doing it. Getting glide typing back means re-patching
without Swipe Left to Delete.

## Swipe right to undo

Swiping right *during* a delete puts the words back — that is Gboard's own behaviour, and it stops
the moment you lift your finger. Swiping right **after** you have lifted now undoes the delete too.

Two limits worth knowing, both inherited rather than chosen:

- **It only works as the very next thing you do.** Gboard keeps one deleted phrase and clears it on
  almost any other input, so typing a character after the delete loses the undo.
- **One level.** Undo once and the slot is empty; a second right-swipe does nothing.

It is always on when the patch is applied. Swiping right after a delete did nothing at all in stock
Gboard, so nothing is being taken away by giving it a meaning — and Gboard fills the same undo slot
when you swipe on the backspace key, so it works there too.

## Swipe up to undo autocorrect

Swipe up on the keyboard to put back the word an autocorrect just replaced. Gboard can already do
this on backspace, behind its **Undo autocorrect with backspace** setting; this adds a gesture for
it, and the gesture works with that setting off.

The revert is Gboard's own. The swipe asks Gboard's decoder for the same autocorrect revert it uses
for a physical keyboard's delete-word, so the decoder decides whether there is an autocorrection to
undo, as it does for backspace. If there is none, the swipe does nothing: it does not delete a word
or undo some other edit. Either way the key you swiped on is not typed.

**It reaches only the word just corrected.** As soon as you type anything after the correction,
even one letter, Gboard forgets it and the swipe has nothing to undo. Backspace's undo behaves the
same way. Keeping Flexboard's own history of corrections to reach further back was considered, and
the native behaviour kept instead.

The swipe has to be reasonably vertical, at least twice as far up as sideways, which keeps it apart
from **Swipe left to delete** and **Swipe right to undo**.

Confirmed on a device in 2.5.2-dev.0. It was rebuilt one step per release after the first attempt
crashed the keyboard on a swipe up; [`docs/undo-autocorrect-plan.md`](docs/undo-autocorrect-plan.md)
has the story. **On by default.**

## Text action buttons

Adds **Select all**, **Copy** and **Paste** buttons to the toolbar above the keyboard. One tap
each, on whatever you are typing into.

Gboard can already do all three, behind its **Text editing** toolbar button — open that panel, then
tap the one you want. These are the same actions without the panel.

They share the toolbar's capacity, which can push whatever used to be last into the
overflow menu behind the chevron. Long-press the toolbar to reorder them like any other button.

The labels are Gboard's own, so they are already translated wherever Gboard is. The icons are
Material's — the select-all marquee, and the familiar copy and paste marks. Gboard ships all three
and draws none of them, because its text editing panel spells the actions out in words rather than
using icons; that is why Select all first shipped borrowing an unrelated icon. These three use
Gboard's own icons; the hotkeys below use a separate Flexboard icon pack.

## Toolbar hotkeys

Eight more toolbar buttons, each typing a string you set under **Hotkeys** in Flexboard's settings —
an email address, a signature, "brb", whatever you type often enough to resent typing.

**A slot you have not filled in makes no button.** Fresh out of the box there are no hotkeys at all;
fill one in and its icon appears on the toolbar. Clearing its text hides the button when the toolbar
is rebuilt (for example after switching IMEs or restarting), since there is no mid-session removal.
That is the on/off switch, and it is per-button.

Each button is named by your own text, so they are easy to tell apart when you long-press to
reorder the toolbar. On the bar itself there is only room for the icon. Flexboard bundles a picker
of 24 vector icons, including digits 0–9. The eight slot defaults are email, password, phone,
post office, home pin, work, heart and star. A slot's settings row opens an editor with a text
field and the icon picker, and shows the selected icon beside its text.

Long text is fine. The whole of it gets typed; only the first line, cut short, becomes the name.

**Eleven buttons is more than the bar holds** — unless *Bigger toolbar* is applied, which is what it
is for. Without it, the three text actions plus a few hotkeys push whatever used to sit at the end
of your toolbar into the overflow menu behind the chevron. Long-press the toolbar to reorder, and
drop what you do not need.

## Bigger toolbar

Gboard's toolbar holds five icons. Flexboard adds eleven of its own — eight hotkeys and three text
actions — and those eleven compete with the emoji, clipboard and settings buttons already there. So
the bar is the limit on everything above, and this patch raises it to twelve.

**It does not decide how many you see.** Choosing what sits on the bar is Gboard's own job, done by
long-pressing the toolbar and dragging icons in or out, and this patch does not touch it. All it
changes is the ceiling that choice runs into. Take a button off and it stays off; the count is
yours.

That distinction is the whole patch, and it is the part two earlier attempts got wrong. Both tried
to set the number of icons themselves, and both ended up fighting the toolbar customise screen —
one of them putting buttons back after they had been removed. Gboard treats *"take this off the
bar"* as lowering the count, so anything that forces the count up undoes the removal. Raising only
the ceiling cannot do that.

Two things worth knowing. Twelve icons on a phone are narrow — the bar divides the width it has
rather than scrolling — so twelve is the room available, not a recommendation. And if you had
already trimmed your toolbar before applying this, you will still see your old number until you
drag more icons onto the bar, because that number is your setting and the patch leaves it alone.

## Hidden features

Gboard gates features behind per-signature flags that a resigned build may not receive. The
default-on patch enables **grammar check** and **dismissable suggestion chips**; both were seen
working on a device. Five other flags were tried and removed: on-device Proofread prevented Gboard
from starting, and Emoji Kitchen browse, the custom sticker tab, offline translation and settings
search never showed any effect. Forcing a flag does not supply downloaded models, locale allowlists
or language packs behind it.

## Enable Rambler

Rambler is Gboard's agentic dictation option in **Voice** settings. Flexboard reveals the choice;
it does not select it or give consent on your behalf. The feature uses a server and has its own
quota. Choosing Rambler in Gboard is what switches it on.

## Modern keypress haptics

Gboard ships a haptic-primitives path but gives its minimum Android version an impossible value.
This patch lowers that minimum to API 30. Gboard still checks hardware support; where primitives
aren't available it keeps the legacy vibration path. With primitives, the slider value describes
intensity rather than milliseconds. The result has not been tested on a device for feel.

## Suggested Settings

This default-on patch turns on **Flick keys to enter symbols**, **Touch & hold keys for numbers**,
the suggestion strip, grammar check and smart replies; it turns off offensive-word blocking and
word suggestions. Each preference is written only when unset, so changes you make in Gboard stick.
The grammar check row also needs the [Hidden Features](#hidden-features) patch to be visible on a
resigned build.

Gboard's own flick row depends on **Touch & hold keys for numbers**, which this patch enables so
the flick setting can be changed. Earlier Flexboard builds also wrote a slide-sensitivity value of
0.6, which isn't a choice on Gboard's slider and doesn't control swipe-up. This patch removes that
old value once, if it is still 0.6; other values are left alone.

## Install as Gboard clone

Renames the package so the patched build installs beside the official Gboard rather than replacing
it. Both keyboards stay in the picker, which is why the install steps above end with enabling and
choosing the new one.

Untick it and the patched build replaces the Gboard you already have.

## Bypass Gboard signature

Gboard hashes its own signing certificate and compares it against a list baked into the app. A
patched build is re-signed, so the cold-start self-check fails. Flexboard skips that self-check's
failure branch; it leaves the check itself intact for other callers.

The self-check gates no feature: that call site does nothing except check and throw if it fails.
Patched **without** this one the keyboard still opens — the exception lands on a background thread
during startup and everything carries on. A second caller protects Gboard's exported debug bridge;
its signature verification must stay intact.

It is kept anyway, because an exception on every cold start is worth silencing even when it is
survivable, and because assuming it stays harmless on every device is a worse bet than simply
patching it out.

## Vibration Slider Everywhere

Gboard hides its own vibration-strength slider on some devices and sends users to Android's
system haptic settings instead. This patch makes Gboard use its own slider on every device; the
keypress vibration toggle still governs whether vibration runs at all.

## Crash reporter (debug)

For reporting a bug. With this patch on, a keyboard crash is recorded: the error is saved, and the
next time the keyboard starts it is copied to your clipboard, ready to paste into a bug report.
Android's own crash handling is unchanged.

Copying the report replaces whatever was on your clipboard, which is why it is a patch you opt into.
It was built while **Swipe up to undo autocorrect** was crashing the keyboard on devices with no
other way to read the error. **Off by default.**
