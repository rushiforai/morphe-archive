"""Is this patch bundle built from the code in front of you?

A bundle is a build artifact. Applying one proves something about the commit it was built from, and
nothing whatever about the working tree -- but the driver lane reports PASS either way, and a stale
bundle passing looks exactly like a current one passing.

That is not a hypothetical. The driver lane ran green for a whole session against the 2.5.0-dev.2
bundle while the tree carried a tightened guard that bundle knew nothing about. The guard's first
contact with a matching bundle failed immediately.

Three questions, in order of how badly they catch you:

1. Does the bundle's version match `gradle.properties`? Catches the obvious case -- last release's
   bundle against this release's tree.
2. Was it built *after* the last commit touching the patch sources? Version is necessary and not
   sufficient: two bundles can both say `2.5.0-dev.3` and differ by every commit in between, which
   is the normal state of affairs while iterating on a release.
3. Are those sources clean? An uncommitted edit cannot be in any bundle, so the answer is no before
   it is asked.

Exit 0 when the bundle can speak for the tree, 1 with a reason when it cannot. The caller is
expected to skip rather than fail: a bundle that is merely old is not a broken build.
