"""Check every patch-time assertion against a Gboard dex, before anything reaches a device.

## Why this exists

Nothing in the pipeline applies the bundle to an APK. CI compiles Kotlin; the patches themselves
only ever run inside Morphe, on the user's phone. So between "it compiles" and "it works" there is
no step at all, and the two releases that got that wrong both reached a device before anything
noticed: `0.0.1-dev.1` emitted an instruction that failed ART's verifier, and `0.0.2-dev.1` looked
up a field on the wrong class and refused to apply.

This closes that gap for the cheap half of the problem. Each check below mirrors one
`check(...)`/`error(...)` in the Kotlin, evaluated against the real dex. It cannot prove a patch
*works* — only Morphe applying it and a device running it can do that — but it catches every
binding that has moved, which is what a Gboard version bump actually breaks.

## Use

    python3 -c "
    import zipfile
    z = zipfile.ZipFile('gboard.apk')
    for n in z.namelist():
        if n.endswith('.dex'):
            z.extract(n, '/tmp/gb')
    "
    python3 tools/apk/preflight.py /tmp/gb

Exits non-zero if anything fails, so it can gate a bump.

## Updating it for a new Gboard

Edit `BINDINGS` and the register counts in `EXPECTED`. Everything else is structural and should
carry over untouched — if a *check* needs rewriting rather than a constant, that is the signal that
a patch needs rewriting too.
