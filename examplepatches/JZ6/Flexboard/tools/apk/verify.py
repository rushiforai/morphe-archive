"""Checks over every method a patch changed, for the bugs ART only reports on a phone.

Three of them: a register type-merge conflict (rejected at class load), a call into the extension
that nothing declares (throws when the call runs), and a reference the patched class is not allowed
to make (throws when the instruction runs). The first is most of this file; the other two are
sections at the end.

## Why

`:driver:run` writes a dex; it does not load one, so ART's verifier never runs. A method that is
rejected at class load applies cleanly through the whole pipeline and only fails on a phone, as a
keyboard that will not open. That shipped twice.

The rejection this catches: a register holding one type on one path into a block and an unrelated
type on another, where the block then uses it as a specific type. `2.5.0-dev.0` branched to a block
that does `iget-object v13, v3, Lpvi;->B:…` while our path had just made `v3` a `Lpmy;`.

## What it is, and what it is not

This is **not** a reimplementation of ART's verifier. It is a forward abstract interpretation over
switch cases and the DEX try-handler ranges with a deliberately small type lattice, tuned to be quiet:

* types come only from instructions that state one outright — `new-instance`, `sget-object`,
  `iget-object`, `check-cast`, `const-string`, `move-result-object` after a call with a known
  return type, and the method's own parameters
* anything else is `UNKNOWN`, and **`UNKNOWN` is never reported**
* a literal zero is `ZERO`, which merges with any reference, because null is assignable to anything
* two different references merge to `CONFLICT` only when neither is assignable to the other, using
  the class hierarchy from the dex where it is available

A finding is raised only when a `CONFLICT` reaches an instruction that *demands* a type — a field
owner, an `iput-object` value, an invoke receiver. That is the shape ART rejects, and requiring the
use site keeps the false-positive rate near zero: merging two unrelated types into a register nobody
reads is legal and common.

False negatives are the accepted trade. A checker that cries wolf gets switched off, and this
project has enough checks that pass without meaning something.

## Access

An emission runs as code *of the class it is injected into*, and ART holds it to that class's
access rights. `2.5.1-dev.9` emitted `instance-of Lozi;` and `iget Lozi;->b` into
`ScrubMotionEventHandler`, in `com.google...scrubmove`; `Lozi;` is package-private and lives in the
unnamed package. ART does not reject the class for that — an access failure is a *soft* verification
failure — so the keyboard opened, and the instruction threw `IllegalAccessError` the first time it
ran, on every swipe up. Nothing here could see it, and the device had no logcat to say so.

The rule checked is ART's: a class is accessible when it is public or in the host's package; a
member when it is public, private to the host itself, in the host's package, or protected and the
host is a subclass. The class named in the reference is checked, then the member where resolution
finds it, which is the order ART uses. A reference whose class or member is outside the APK —
anything in the framework — cannot be judged and is counted as unchecked, never as passed.
