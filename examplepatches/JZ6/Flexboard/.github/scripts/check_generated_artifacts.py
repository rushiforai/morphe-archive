"""`patches-list.json` and the README's patch table agree with the Kotlin that produced them.

## Why

Both files are generated, and both are generated **only during a release**. Between releases the
source can gain a patch, rename one, or flip a default, and the committed artifacts go on
describing the previous state. `patches-list.json` says in its own first key that third-party tools
read it, and the README table is what anyone evaluating the project sees first.

This has drifted in practice. A feature commit once rewrote the generated README block by hand,
changing the channel label and the patch count, and nothing objected.

## What it can and cannot check

Regenerating `patches-list.json` needs `generatePatchesList`, which needs the Android SDK, which
is not here. So this does not regenerate — it reads the **Kotlin declarations** and compares. That
catches a patch added, removed, renamed, or given a different default without the artifact being
rebuilt, which is the whole of the drift that actually happens.

It does not check the description text, because `bytecodePatch` builds those by string
concatenation across lines and comparing a reassembled approximation against the real thing would
fail on whitespace rather than on meaning. Names and defaults are exact.
