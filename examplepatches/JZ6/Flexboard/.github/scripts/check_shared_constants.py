"""Do the patch and the extension still agree about the preference contract?

The preference keys and their defaults exist twice: once in the Kotlin patches, which read them out
of Gboard's store at runtime, and once in `FlexboardSettingsActivity`, which writes them. They cannot
be shared — the Activity is compiled into the extension DEX, a separate Gradle module with no
dependency on the patches — so both sides carry a comment pointing at the other.

A comment is not a check. Change one side alone and everything still compiles, the settings screen
still renders, the slider still moves, and the value it writes is simply read back under a different
key or compared against a different default. Nothing fails until someone notices a setting doing
nothing on a phone.

    check_shared_constants.py        -> silent, or exits 1 listing every disagreement
