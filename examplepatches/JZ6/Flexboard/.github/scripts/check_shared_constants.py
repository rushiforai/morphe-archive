"""Do the patch and the extension still agree about the preference contract?

Some values exist twice: once in the Kotlin patches and once in the extension's Java. Preference keys
and their defaults, because the patches read Gboard's store at runtime and `FlexboardSettingsActivity`
writes it; and the action ordinals the patches hand `TextAction`, which maps them to framework
context-menu ids. They cannot be shared — the extension is a separate Gradle module with no
dependency on the patches — so both sides carry a comment pointing at the other.

A comment is not a check. Change one side alone and everything still compiles, the settings screen
still renders, the slider still moves, and the value it writes is simply read back under a different
key or compared against a different default. Nothing fails until someone notices a setting doing
nothing on a phone.
