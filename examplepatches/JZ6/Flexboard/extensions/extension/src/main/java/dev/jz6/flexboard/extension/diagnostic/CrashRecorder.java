/**
 * Records why the keyboard crashed, and puts it on the clipboard the next time it starts.
 *
 * <p>Exists because a swipe-up build crashed the keyboard on a device with no logcat, no adb and no
 * way to read a stack trace, and three releases had already been spent choosing between explanations
 * that all looked equally plausible. The exception is one line of fact; the guesses were not. This
 * turns a crash into a thing you can paste.
 *
 * <p>Installed at app start, only by the opt-in "Crash reporter (debug)" patch. It is a diagnostic,
 * not a feature: it overwrites the clipboard after a crash, which is a side effect nobody who has
 * not asked for it should have.
 *
 * <p>Two steps, because a process that is dying cannot do anything slow:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>on an uncaught exception, {@link #record} saves the trace with a synchronous
 *       {@code commit()} — {@code apply()} writes on a background thread and the process is about to
 *       be killed — and then hands the exception to whatever handler was installed before, so
 *       Android's own crash handling is unchanged;</li>
 *   <li>on the next start, {@link #deliver} copies the saved trace to the clipboard and deletes it.
 *       If the clipboard is unavailable the trace is kept and tried again on the next start, rather
 *       than lost.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The installed handler, install and delivery paths catch {@code Throwable}; the direct
 * {@code record} helper is called from inside the handler's catch. A crash reporter that itself
 * crashes the keyboard is worse than none.
