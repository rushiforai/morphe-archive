/**
 * Flexboard's settings screen.
 *
 * <p>This class is merged into Gboard's APK rather than shipped as its own app, so it cannot rely
 * on any resources of its own resolving at runtime. Every view is built in code, every string is a
 * constant, and only framework widgets are used — no AndroidX, no layout inflation, nothing that
 * assumes anything about the host.
 *
 * <p><b>It is meant to look like a Gboard settings screen.</b> It cannot be one: androidx's
 * preference rows are unavailable to a class that ships no resources, so the rows here are
 * hand-built to approximately androidx's metrics — 16dp insets, 16sp titles, 14sp summaries,
 * sentence-case category headers.
 *
 * <p>What it does not approximate is the palette. {@code SettingsScreenPatch} copies Gboard's own
 * settings theme onto this Activity's manifest entry, so the colours are read from theme attributes
 * and come out identical to the screens either side of it, Material You included. Only if an
 * attribute fails to resolve does it fall back to a fixed pair of palettes chosen by
 * {@link Configuration#uiMode}, which is what every build before this one used and why the screen
 * looked foreign on a themed device.
 *
 * <p><b>Chrome depends on what that theme provides.</b> An earlier attempt at
 * {@code Theme.DeviceDefault.Settings} clipped its top row: Gboard targets SDK 37, so on Android 15
 * and up the window is edge-to-edge and content starts underneath the status bar unless something
 * insets it — and if an action bar has already absorbed that inset, applying it again is just as
 * wrong. So both cases are handled rather than assumed: the title comes from the action bar when
 * there is one and from {@link #addHeading} when there is not, and the top inset is applied only in
 * the latter case. See {@link #hasActionBar()} for why a theme with a bar does not guarantee this
 * Activity gets one.
 *
 * <p><b>It writes to Gboard's own preference file, deliberately.</b> Gboard's store
 * (<code>Lqhy;</code>) is constructed with a null name, which resolves to
 * <code>PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences</code> — that is
 * <code>&lt;packageName&gt;_preferences</code> in <code>MODE_PRIVATE</code>, on a
 * <b>device-protected</b> context. See {@link #preferenceContext()} — that last part is not a
 * detail but a different file on disk, and getting it wrong is why every slider on this screen did
 * nothing at all before <code>v0.1.0-dev.7</code>. Deriving the name from
 * {@link #getPackageName()} is what keeps it correct after the package-rename patch, since both
 * sides resolve the same running package.
 *
 * <p>The keys must match the ones the bytecode patches read. They are duplicated as literals in
 * <code>ScrubTuningPatch.kt</code> and <code>ToolbarCountPatch.kt</code>, because a patch-added
 * resource has no id until aapt2 recompiles and so cannot be addressed from bytecode.
 * <code>check_shared_constants.py</code> fails the build when the two sides disagree.
 *
 * <p><b>Every section is shown whether or not its patch was applied.</b> The screen is one merged
 * class and cannot know which patches the user ticked, so a slider for a patch that is not installed
 * moves and stores and does nothing. Grouping by feature is what makes that legible; making it
 * conditional would need a marker preference written at app start, which is another bytecode
 * insertion for a cosmetic gain.
