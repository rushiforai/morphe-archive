/**
 * Flexboard's starting values, written into Gboard's preference file the first time the app runs.
 *
 * <p><b>Why written rather than defaulted.</b> Every other value in this project takes effect as
 * the fallback operand of a preference read emitted into Gboard's bytecode — the number lives in
 * the patch, and an unset preference picks it up. That has one property worth avoiding here: the
 * default follows the code, so changing it in a later release moves every user who never touched
 * the slider. Someone who has spent a month with a keyboard should not find it different after an
 * update they did not ask for.
 *
 * <p>Writing once inverts that. The first run after installing decides, the value is then an
 * ordinary stored preference indistinguishable from one the user set, and later releases can pick
 * different starting numbers for new installs without disturbing anyone.
 *
 * <p><b>Only when unset.</b> Each key is guarded separately rather than behind a single "have we
 * seeded" marker, so a partial grant still fills in whatever arrived after it. The framework's own
 * {@link SharedPreferences#contains} is the test, which is also why nothing here names anything of
 * Gboard's.
 *
 * <p><b>Where this runs.</b> {@code seedDefaultsPatch} calls it from Gboard's Application start,
 * before any keyboard is built and so before any of these is read. The patched call passes the
 * {@code LatinApp} itself, which is an {@code Application} and therefore a {@link Context}; nothing
 * obfuscated crosses the boundary.
 *
 * <p>All keys are seeded whichever patches were applied. A key belonging to a patch the user
 * did not pick is inert — read by nothing — and the alternative is threading patch selection into
 * the extension, which is the same wart the settings screen already documents for its sections.
