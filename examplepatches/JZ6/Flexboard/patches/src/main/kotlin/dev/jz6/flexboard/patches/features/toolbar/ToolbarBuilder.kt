/**
 * The derivation of Gboard's access-point builder API.
 *
 * The builder class is R8-renamed on every Gboard build and its setters are five same-shaped
 * `(I)V` aliases — the kind of type that produced Flexboard's worst regression (`0.0.1-dev.1`
 * shipped against the wrong letter because nothing told the setters apart). So this derivation
 * does not "guess by name". It anchors on:
 *
 *  1. A *seed method* — the sole site in the dex that loads the text-editing access point's
 *     three resource ids together. That pins the factory, which pins the builder's class.
 *  2. The builder's `build()` — generated code that refuses to build an incomplete access
 *     point and names what is missing as string literals (`" icon"`, `" label"`,
 *     `" contentDescription"`). Each missing-property name is tested against one bit of a
 *     completeness mask, and exactly one `(I)V` setter writes that bit. R8 cannot touch
 *     string literals, so a bit leads from a setter to a name.
 *
 * Everything the patches need from the builder — setters by name, the literal pass-through
 * fields, the Runnable action wiring — hangs off that anchor. [resolveAccessPointBuilder] is
 * called per patch; each gets the same derived shape.
