/**
 * The foundation every Flexboard patch needs.
 *
 * Merges the extension DEX, seeds the default preferences (Flexboard's own), publishes the
 * running IME service to the extension, and adds the Flexboard entry to Gboard's settings
 * screen. Every public patch depends on this, so a user cannot select a feature without the
 * foundation it rests on — the extension is always merged, the defaults are always seeded, the
 * service is always reachable, and the settings row is always there.
 *
 * Internal so it never appears in Morphe's patch list. It runs as a dependency of every public
 * patch and is always selected when any of them is.
