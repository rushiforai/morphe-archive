/**
 * Raises how many icons Gboard's toolbar can hold, from five to [TOOLBAR_CAPACITY].
 *
 * Flexboard admits nine toolbar ids — six hotkeys and three text actions — and stock Gboard shows
 * five icons, shared with Gboard's own access points. A user cannot display even the six hotkeys
 * that shipped. The capacity is the binding constraint on two released features.
 *
 * ## What this patch does not do
 *
 * It does not touch the count, and it writes no preference. That is the whole design, and it is
 * the part both previous attempts got wrong. Gboard computes the rendered count as
 *
 * ```
 * Lmku;->b(I)I  ->  Lmjv;->a(pref, capacity) = pref >= 0 ? min(pref, capacity) : capacity
 * ```
 *
 * and expresses *"take this icon off the bar"* as a **decrease of `pref`**, leaving the button in
 * the order list. So `min(pref, capacity)` is not an obstacle to be worked around — it is the
 * mechanism by which the user removes buttons. Anything that forces the count upward puts removed
 * buttons back.
 *
 * `ToolbarCountPatch` (removed in 54703a9) overrode the count at the entry of `Lmku;->b(I)I`,
 * bypassing the gate; its release note admits drag-to-reorder was never exercised.
 * `BiggerToolbarPatch` (reverted in e075526) raised the capacity and then restaged Gboard's count
 * preference on every bar construction, which was reported on device as buttons reappearing after
 * being removed. Raise the ceiling, leave the count alone, and both failures are structurally
 * impossible -- and confirmed on a device: an icon taken off the bar stays off across a
 * rebuild. See `docs/toolbar-capacity.md`.
 *
 * ## The derivation
 *
 * The capacity comes from a Phenotype flag whose compiled-in default is `-1`:
 *
 * ```
 * AccessPointsBar-><clinit>()V
 *   const-string   v0, "config_max_access_points"
 *   const-wide/16  v1, -0x1                      <- becomes TOOLBAR_CAPACITY
 *   invoke-static  {…}, Lnxs;->e(Ljava/lang/String;JLjava/lang/String;)Lnxp;
 * ```
 *
 * and the constructor accepts it only within `[3, 8]`, falling back to the styled attribute (5)
 * otherwise:
 *
 * ```
 * AccessPointsBar-><init>(Context, AttributeSet)V
 *   const/4    v3, 0x3      # lower bound -- also the getDimension index, see below
 *   const/4    v4, 0x5      # styled-attribute fallback
 *   …
 *   invoke-interface {v5}, Lnxp;->g()Ljava/lang/Object;
 *   invoke-virtual   {v5}, Ljava/lang/Long;->intValue()I
 *   move-result v4
 *   const/16   v5, 0x8      <- becomes TOOLBAR_CAPACITY
 *   if-gt      v4, v5, :reject
 *   if-lt      v4, v3, :reject
 *   goto       :accept
 *   :reject
 *   move       v4, v2
 *   :accept
 *   iput       v4, v6, AccessPointsBar->m:I
 * ```
 *
 * `-1` fails the lower bound, which is why stock is five. Both edits are needed: raising the
 * ceiling alone leaves the default failing, and raising the default alone leaves it above the
 * ceiling. Each is a literal rewrite in the same instruction format, so no offset moves and every
 * branch target in the constructor stays valid.
 *
 * ## Why the lower bound is left alone
 *
 * `const/4 v3, 0x3` is not only the clamp's floor. `v3` is read again further down as the
 * styled-attribute index for `getDimension`, so moving it would corrupt the bar's padding. Only
 * the ceiling is safe to touch, and [raiseClamp] asserts the floor's test is still there rather
 * than assuming it.
 *
 * ## Known limits
 *
 * A Phenotype push would override the default and the capacity would revert — this edits the
 * fallback, not the served value. No override is present on 18.0.3; beating one would need a hook
 * on `Lnxp;->g()` and an insertion, which is more machinery than the case currently justifies.
 *
 * A user whose `access_points_count_on_bar` is already low still sees their own number and must
 * raise it in Gboard's own toolbar settings. Seeding it for them is exactly what produced the
 * phantom 15 in f812fd9 and the regression in e075526, so it is deliberately not done.
