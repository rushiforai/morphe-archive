 * `long`, declared through the `J` flag factory rather than the `Z` one.

/**
 * Turns on Google Rambler — Gboard's agentic dictation, internally *jetson*.
 *
 * ## What was actually in the way
 *
 * Six conditions gate `Lmev;->B(Context)`: three booleans, a module registration, a user preference,
 * and [AD_ACTIVATION_TYPE]. Only the last one is interesting. It is a `long`, and this project's
 * flag helper is boolean-only, which was originally read as "out of reach" — wrongly.
 * `ToolbarCapacityPatch` has rewritten a long-valued flag literal in place since the toolbar work,
 * and that is all this needs. See `docs/phenotype-flags.md`.
 *
 * ## What this does and does not do
 *
 * It **exposes the option**; it does not switch the feature on behind the user's back. Once the
 * flags are set, Rambler appears as a choice in Gboard's Voice settings, and choosing it is what
 * writes the `enable_jetson` preference the remaining conditions read. That is deliberate: the
 * feature talks to a server, has a quota and records a consent, and none of those are things a
 * patch should accept on someone's behalf.
 *
 * Only three of the six flags in this family are actually off. `config_agentic_dictation`,
 * `enable_jetson_in_toolbar` and `filter_rambler_contributed_input_view_session` all resolve to 1
 * on 18.0.3 — the last two by sharing a constant that holds 1, which is why "hoisted" is not a
 * synonym for "off" and why the effective value has to be read rather than inferred from the
 * sharing.
 *
 * All three that *are* off use the isolating emission, and the reason differs. The two rambler
 * toolbar flags inherit a constant written earlier. `enable_agentic_dictation` writes its own —
 * and is still shared, because `agentic_dictation_enable_promo_banner` reads the same register
 * afterwards without rewriting it. Owning the constant that precedes you says nothing about who
 * reads it next; both directions have to be checked, and both now are.
 *
 * ## On by default
 *
 * Confirmed working on a device before this was flipped, which is the whole of the rule in
 * `AGENTS.md`: flags ship opt-in until watched working, because a forced flag can open a gate onto
 * machinery a resigned build cannot supply and the failure mode is a keyboard that will not start.
 * A sibling flag in this same family — `enable_on_device_proofread`, the Writing Tools stack —
 * did exactly that and cost a four-release bisect.
 *
 * What it enables is still the *option*, not the feature. Rambler appears in Voice settings and
 * the user chooses it; that choice is what writes `enable_jetson` and records the consent. Nobody
 * gets agentic dictation switched on without asking for it.
