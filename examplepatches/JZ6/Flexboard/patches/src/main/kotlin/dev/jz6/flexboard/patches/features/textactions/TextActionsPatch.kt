/**
 * Adds **Select all**, **Copy** and **Paste** buttons to Gboard's toolbar.
 *
 * ## Why these are not built the way they look like they should be
 *
 * Gboard has all three already, and none of them is reachable from anywhere but its own text
 * editing panel. `TEXT_EDITING_SELECT_ALL` is **-10086**, and that number appears exactly once in
 * the whole app — as an entry in the name-to-value map `Lppf;-><clinit>` builds so keyboard XML can
 * resolve `<key_code>`. Two packed-switches cover it and neither acts on it: one is a classifier
 * ("is this a text-editing keycode"), the other is usage metrics. The only implementation is the
 * text-editing keyboard's own consume-event hook, which runs only while that panel is open.
 *
 * That was checked in every encoding a keycode can take — `const/16`, 32-bit `const`,
 * sparse-switch payloads, and packed-switch **ranges**. The last one is the check that matters and
 * the one that is easy to skip: a packed-switch stores only its first key, so a literal search for
 * -10086 misses it entirely.
 *
 * Undo is a misleading template here. UNDO (-10045) *is* consumed at IME level, by four separate
 * handlers, which is why Flexboard's undo works from anywhere. These have no equivalent. A button
 * emitting -10086 would render, press, highlight, and do nothing.
 *
 * ## What is used instead
 *
 * Gboard has a keycode whose payload is an arbitrary `Runnable`. The builder's
 * `(Ljava/lang/Runnable;)V` setter stores no field — it wraps the Runnable as key data with
 * keycode **-40007** (`0xffff63b9`), and that *is* dispatched at IME level: `Lmln;->m(Lnur;)Z`
 * reaches `Runnable.run()` through a packed-switch covering [-40013, -40001).
 *
 * Two other classes test -40007 and **decline** it. Neither is the runner, and mistaking one for
 * the runner is the obvious way to get this wrong.
 *
 * So each button carries a Runnable, the Runnable lives in the extension, and it calls
 * `InputConnection.performContextMenuAction` — the same thing Gboard's own panel does, reached
 * without any of Gboard's own plumbing. One extension class serves all three, told apart by an
 * ordinal; see `TextAction` for why that rather than three classes or a framework id.
 *
 * ## Why nothing is published or registered
 *
 * The obvious route is to build access-point *notifications* and register them the way Gboard's own
 * providers do. That route was abandoned: the providers only store their notifications in fields,
 * and what later publishes them was never established.
 *
 * It turned out not to be needed. The method that decides what goes on the bar takes the ordered
 * list **as a parameter**, and only ever reads it — a size, and two `subList` calls:
 *
 * ```
 * n = min(<bar capacity>, list.size())
 * subList(0, n)     -> the bar
 * subList(n, size)  -> the overflow panel
 * ```
 *
 * So a patch can substitute its own list at entry and the whole notification machinery is
 * bypassed. The buttons are prepended in order, which is why they appear first and in the order
 * listed below.
 *
 * ## Why the builder setters are derived rather than named
 *
 * The builder exposes **five** setters sharing the signature `(I)V`. That is precisely the shape
 * that produced this project's worst bug: on 17.7.7 the undo re-commit was `s`, on 18 it is `t`,
 * and a different method inherited `s` — same signature, silently wrong behaviour. Naming a letter
 * here would be the same bet.
 *
 * They are told apart by **Gboard's own words for them**. The builder is generated code that
 * refuses to build an incomplete access point, and the refusal names what is missing — `" icon"`,
 * `" label"`, `" contentDescription"` — each tested against one bit of a completeness mask that
 * exactly one setter writes. String literals are the one thing R8 leaves alone, so a bit leads
 * from a setter to a name. [resolveAccessPointBuilder] does the walk.
 *
 * The labels are Gboard's own, already present because its text editing panel shows them. The icons
 * are Material's, which Gboard bundles — see [BUTTONS] for how they were found, given that every
 * drawable name in the app has been collapsed.
 *
 * ## Hotkeys
 *
 * The same button, with `commitText` in place of a context-menu id and nothing known at patch
 * time: the text is the user's, and so is whether the button exists at all. So six slots are
 * emitted, each guarded on the extension reporting that slot occupied, and each labelled with the
 * user's own snippet rather than a Gboard string — see [HOTKEY_ICONS] and
 * [AccessPointBuilder.labelField].

 * Prepends the buttons to the list the bar is built from.
 *
 * The target is derived by shape rather than name: the sole method taking a `List` that splits it
 * with two `subList` calls around a `Math.min`. Those are framework references, so the derivation
 * survives R8 renaming everything around them.
 *
 * The incoming list is Guava-immutable, so it is copied into an `ArrayList` rather than added to.
 * `p1` is only ever read by the stock body — a size and the two `subList` calls — so substituting
 * it at entry is safe. v0..v4 are dead there by backward liveness over the real CFG, not by a
 * forward first-touch scan, which is unsound and nearly shipped register corruption once already.
 *
 * Each button is inserted at its own index rather than all at zero, because repeated insertion at
 * zero would reverse them.
 *
 * The hotkeys follow, and go in the other way round: every one of them inserts at the same index,
 * just past the text actions, in **reverse** slot order. That is what lets a slot be skipped
 * without arithmetic — a fixed index means present slots close up behind the text actions however
 * many are empty, and reversing the emission order puts slot 1 leftmost again. The alternative, a
 * running counter, would need a register this method does not have to spare.
