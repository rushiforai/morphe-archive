/**
 * The vibration provider's mode selector and its suppression gate, both obfuscated.
 *
 * Read the pin honestly: [COMPATIBILITY_GBOARD] is metadata, not a gate. `Patcher` never reads
 * `compatiblePackages` — only the host UI does — so a user on a different build is not stopped,
 * and these two anchors are bare R8 letters. `Lpho;` is matched by class + name + return type, and
 * 133 classes in this dex declare an `n()Z`, 124 of them short obfuscated names of exactly the
 * kind R8 recycles between builds. A moved name here does not fail loudly; it silently matches
 * something else and the constant-return overwrite lands in an unrelated method.
 *
 * The defence is therefore in the patch, not in the pin: [VibrationPatch] asserts the *shape* of
 * each method before overwriting it, so a recycled letter fails the assertion instead of the
 * build. Anchor shape, not names.
 *
 * The one unobfuscated name in the chain is `VibrationDurationPreference`, which is how the mode
 * method was found: its `ap(I)V` calls `Lphk;->a()Lphm;` → `Lphm;->f(I)V`, and the real provider
 * `Lpho;` is the implementation that gets installed at IME start. `Lphn;` is the class the settings
 * fragment and the provider both ask for the mode. None of those three names survives R8, but
 * none of them needs to: the build pin is what holds them.
