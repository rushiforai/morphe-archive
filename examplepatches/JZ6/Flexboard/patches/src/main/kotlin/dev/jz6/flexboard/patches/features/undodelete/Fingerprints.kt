 *
 * **This was `N:Z` on 17.7.7.** Gboard 18 inserted a field into `AbstractIme`, shifting every letter
 * from `C` down by one, so the flag is now `O` — and `N` still exists as an unrelated boolean. A
 * letter carried over unchecked would therefore have assembled, verified and silently tested the

 * required assembles cleanly, then fails verification at run time and takes the dispatcher with it,
 * which is the whole keyboard. That shipped in `0.0.1-dev.1`.
 *
 * Only the field's *name* is pinned here. Its declaring class and type are resolved out of the dex
 * at patch time, because which class to name is not a free choice: the emitted `iget-object`
 * requires the register to be a subclass of whatever class the descriptor names, and all the patch
 * can prove about that register is that it is at least an [ABSTRACT_IME]. Gboard's own reads spell
 * it `$LATIN_IME->B`, which is correct for Gboard — the verifier knows `this` there — but is a
 * claim this patch cannot make. `AbstractIme` declares the field, so naming the declaring class
 * is both provable and stable.

 * **Pinning the letter is what broke `0.0.3-dev.1`.** On 17.7.7 this was `AbstractIme->s(Lnpx;Z)V`;
 * on 18 the same 178-instruction method is called `t`, and `s` is a *different*, much smaller
 * method that inherited the letter with a signature-compatible shape. So the patch kept emitting a
 * call that resolved, verified and ran — to the wrong method. Undo silently did nothing while
 * everything else worked.
 *
 * Nothing static catches that: the method exists, the argument types check, and the base class
 * declarations of both are empty stubs (`return-void`) that `LatinIme` overrides. The only thing
 * that distinguishes them is *which one Gboard's own undo calls*, so that is what this reads.
 *
 * [UNDO_SLOT_GET] is called exactly once in the dispatcher — in the stock `UNDO_MULTI_DELETION`
 * handler — and a few instructions later that handler casts the `Optional`'s contents and hands
 * them to the re-commit. Matching the invoke that follows gives both the method *and* the
 * committable-text type, neither of which then needs a letter written down here.
