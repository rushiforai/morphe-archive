/**
 * Greys out the two rows [forceScrubPreferencesPatch] writes — **Glide typing** and **Glide
 * delete** — and puts a note directly above saying why.
 *
 * That patch writes `enable_gesture_input=false` and `enable_scrub_delete=true` at every app start:
 * a leftward drag across the letters is also a glide input so the two cannot both be live, and the
 * delete handler is attached declaratively so it is never built at all while its own preference is
 * off. Both rows stayed fully tappable throughout, so changing either appeared to work and then
 * silently reverted at the next app start. Greying them makes the constraint visible instead of
 * fought.
 *
 * ## Statically disabled, not a dependency
 *
 * This used to add a `SwitchPreferenceCompat` keyed `flexboard_enabled` with
 * `android:disableDependentsState="true"`, and make both rows `android:dependency` on it — so that
 * turning Flexboard off un-greyed them and handed glide typing back. That switch is gone; see
 * [swipeToDeletePatch].
 *
 * The two mechanisms could not be mixed. androidx requires a preference carrying the dependency's
 * key to exist **in the same hierarchy**, and throws `IllegalStateException` from
 * `registerDependency` otherwise — which would take out the whole gesture settings screen rather
 * than fail quietly. Removing the switch therefore meant removing both `dependency` attributes in
 * the same edit.
 *
 * What replaces them is simpler than what it replaces: `android:enabled="false"` written straight
 * onto each row. A framework attribute, no key, no hierarchy requirement, and nothing that can
 * throw. The rows are greyed for as long as the patch is applied, which is now exactly as long as
 * the preferences are being forced — the two can no longer disagree, because neither is conditional.
 *
 * ## The note is there on purpose
 *
 * A row that greys out with no explanation is worse than the row being tappable, and that argument
 * did not go away with the switch. So a non-selectable, non-persistent `Preference` sits above them
 * saying what is doing it and how to undo it. It carries a key only so this patch can recognise its
 * own work and stay idempotent when a bundle is applied over an already-patched APK.

/**
 * Gboard's **Glide delete** row — "Delete words by gliding left from the Delete key".
 *
 * This is the row [forceScrubPreferencesPatch] writes `true` to on every start, because the
 * handler is attached declaratively and is never built at all while it is off. Left tappable it has
 * the same problem the glide typing row had, one row down: turning it off appears to work and
 * reverts at the next start, and in the meantime the gesture is simply gone.
 *
 * ## This one is positional, and that is worth being honest about
 *
 * Glide typing can be found by what points at it. This row cannot: it and **Glide cursor control**
 * are identical in every respect the decoded XML exposes — same tag, same attribute set, and keys,
 * titles and summaries that are all string resources collapsed to the single name
 * `0_resource_name_obfuscated`. Nothing distinguishes them but order.
 *
 * So it is found by elimination: of the four rows, one is glide typing and one depends on it,
 * leaving two, and Glide delete is the first of those. The assertions cover the shape — four rows,
 * exactly two left after eliminating — but they cannot catch a reorder.
 *
 * What makes that acceptable is the pin. `COMPATIBILITY_GBOARD` fixes this bundle to one Gboard
 * build by version *and* signature, and a reorder cannot reach us without a new build failing that
 * gate first. It is also a milder bet than several the project already makes: the hardcoded
 * resource ids in [forceScrubPreferencesPatch] and `suggestedSettingsPatch` would silently write
 * *wrong preference* on a changed build, where the worst this can do is grey the cursor-control row
 * instead of this one. Cosmetic, and visible the moment the screen is opened.

 * The glide typing row, identified by structure rather than by name.

 *
 * It can be matched by what points at it. Gboard's trail row is the file's only `android:dependency`
 * and it depends on glide typing, so the glide row is the one whose key that dependency names. Both
 * sides are the same resource id, so whatever the decoder emits for the collapsed name it emits the
 * same string for both.
 *
 * That relies on the decoder giving colliding names distinct decoded forms, which it must:
 * `res/xml/settings.xml` is decoded and recompiled by every build of this bundle and all sixteen of
 * its rows carry `@string/0_resource_name_obfuscated` keys. Were those collapsed to one name,
 * recompiling would repoint them at a single resource and Gboard's settings would already be broken
 * in every release so far.
 *
 * If that ever stops holding, every row matches and this fails loudly rather than greying the wrong
