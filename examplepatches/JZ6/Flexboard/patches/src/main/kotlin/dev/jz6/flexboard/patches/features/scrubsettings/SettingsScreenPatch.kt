/**
 * Adds a **Flexboard** entry to Gboard's settings that opens Flexboard's own screen.
 *
 * ## Why an Activity and not a nested screen
 *
 * The first version of this patch appended a nested `<PreferenceScreen>` to
 * `res/xml/settings.xml`, on the theory that androidx renders one as a row that opens a sub-screen.
 * It shipped in `v0.1.0-dev.3` and the row rendered correctly but **did nothing when tapped**.
 *
 * androidx only navigates to a nested screen when the host implements
 * `OnPreferenceStartScreenCallback`:
 *
 * ```java
 * if (getCallbackFragment() instanceof OnPreferenceStartScreenCallback) { … }
 * if (!handled && getActivity() instanceof OnPreferenceStartScreenCallback) { … }
 * // no else — the tap is swallowed
 * ```
 *
 * Gboard's `CommonPreferenceFragment` declares no interfaces and `SettingsActivity` declares none,
 * so the tap went nowhere. Giving a screen its own fragment is no better: Gboard's fragments choose
 * their XML by overriding `CommonPreferenceFragment.aB()I`, so ours would have to subclass a Gboard
 * type, which an extension cannot do without stubbing it.
 *
 * So the entry launches an Activity carried in the extension DEX — the route v0.3 proved works.
 *
 * ## The row names a component, not an action
 *
 * `v0.1.0-dev.4` launched the Activity with an **action**, on the reasoning that an implicit intent
 * resolves in whatever package the rename patch produces and so cannot depend on which `finalize`
 * block ran first. On device it failed with *no application found to handle the action*.
 *
 * Gboard 18.0.3 declares `targetSdkVersion="37"`, and since Android 14 an app targeting 34+ may
 * only deliver an implicit intent to an **exported** component — including to its own components.
 * The intent filter written beside the Activity therefore matched nothing, `startActivity` found no
 * candidate, and the tap raised `ActivityNotFoundException`.
 *
 * So the row names the component outright, which is what v0.3 did and why v0.3 worked. Both
 * `android:targetPackage` and `android:targetClass` are required: `Intent.parseIntent` only calls
 * `setComponent` when it has the pair. An explicit same-app intent reaches a non-exported Activity
 * regardless of Android version, so `exported` stays `false` and the intent filter is gone.
 *
 * Naming the package brings back the ordering problem the action was meant to avoid, and it is
 * solved the way v0.3 solved it: this patch writes whatever the manifest currently says, and the
 * rename patch re-targets the row if it renames afterwards. See `retargetFlexboardSettings` in
 * `PackageRenamePatch.kt` — between them the two orders converge on the same result, and unticking
 * the rename patch leaves the row pointing at the un-renamed package, which is then correct.
 *
 * Both files this touches keep their real names through `aapt2 --collapse-resource-names` — 33 of
 * Gboard's 33,287 entries do, and the settings screens are among them. That is the only reason this
 * patch can address them; see the addressability note in `docs/development.md`.
