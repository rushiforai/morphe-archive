/**
 * Gboard already implements swipe-to-delete-a-word. `ScrubDeleteMotionEventHandler` is the swipe
 * on the backspace key, and everything it does — progressive delete, drag back to restore,
 * distance thresholds, tracking across the full keyboard width — lives in a shared
 * `ScrubMotionEventHandler` that is entirely key-agnostic once a gesture has begun.
 *
 * The only thing scoping it to backspace is one comparison in `g(Landroid/view/MotionEvent;)V`:
 *
 * ```
 * iget   v5, v5, Lpnu;->c:I     # keycode of the key under the finger
 * iget   v6, v1, Lpvs;->a:I     # the configured start keycode, 67 for delete
 * if-ne  v5, v6, -> bail
 * ```
 *
 * So this patch does not implement a gesture. It widens where Gboard's own gesture is allowed to
 * start, in two edits:
 *
 *  1. `ScrubDeleteMotionEventHandler.<init>` passes **-1** instead of `KEYCODE_DEL`.
 *  2. `g()` skips the comparison when the configured keycode is negative.
 *
 * A negative sentinel is what makes the second edit register-free: every Android keycode is
 * non-negative, so the test is `if-ltz` — format 21t, one register, no constant, and therefore no
 * need to prove some register is dead at that point in a 259-instruction method. The same sentinel
 * is what [scrubTuningPatch] tests to scope its values to this handler.
 *
 * ## The sentinel is also the off switch
 *
 * Because *everything* Flexboard does keys off that one negative value, writing `KEYCODE_DEL`
 * instead turns the whole feature off and leaves Gboard exactly as it shipped — the delete swipe
 * back on the backspace key alone, at stock distance and stock hold. So the first edit is not a
 * constant but a choice, read from `flexboard_enabled` at construction.
 *
 * That covers three of the four edits for free: this patch's own `g()` gate, and
 * [scrubTuningPatch]'s hold delay and word cap, all test the sentinel already. Its step-table
 * scaling is the exception and carries its own copy of the test.
 *
 * The other two subclasses are untouched. `ScrubMoveMotionEventHandler` (spacebar cursor) and
 * `InlineSuggestionScrubSpaceMotionEventHandler` both pass 62, so their gate still enforces.
 *
 * See `docs/motion-event-handlers.md` for how all of this was derived.

 * only when the preference says so. The literal is matched rather than the position, and exactly one
 * match is required — the constructor also loads four negative event codes and an attr reference,
 * none of which can be confused with a keycode.
 *
 * The stock constant is **kept** and conditionally overwritten rather than replaced, which is what
 * makes "off" mean stock rather than broken:
 *
 * ```
 *   const/16 v1, 67                 <- stock, untouched
 *   …read flexboard_enabled…
 *   if-eqz vStore, :stock_start_key
 *   const/16 v1, -1
 *   :stock_start_key
 *   const/4 v2, 1                   <- stock resumes
 * ```
 *
 * Three things have to hold, and each is asserted rather than assumed:
 *
 *  - **Every instruction between the constant and `Lpvs;-><init>` is itself a `const`.** That is
 *    what proves the registers they write are dead at the insertion point: they are written before
 *    anything reads them, so borrowing them for the preference call cannot lose a live value. If
 *    Gboard ever computes one of those arguments instead of loading it, this fails loudly.
 *  - **Nothing writes the Context register before the insertion point.** It is derived from the
 *    Dalvik calling convention — parameters occupy the last `ins` registers — rather than guessed.
 *  - **The scratch registers fit in a nibble**, because a `35c` invoke cannot address above v15.
 *
 * One thing is worth naming because it looks alarming and is not. `v0` holds an **uninitialised**
 * `Lpvs;` across the inserted block, since `new-instance` runs before the arguments are built. That
 * is exactly the shape javac emits for `new Foo(cond ? a : b)`: a forward branch merges the same
 * uninitialised type from the same allocation site, which verifies fine. Only a *backward* branch,
 * or an exception handler, with an uninitialised reference live is rejected.
