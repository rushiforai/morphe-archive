/**
 * Registers a single <b>Test</b> button through Gboard's own access-point registry.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Buttons injected by splicing the split method's list — the text actions, the custom hotkeys —
 * work visually but have never persisted through a customize session: the customize-write path
 * reads its commits out of the order manager's registered-provider list, and ours aren't in it.
 * On the next rebuild they snap back to the front regardless of where they were dragged.
 *
 * This patch is the proof the fix works: one button going through the same path native buttons
 * use, so everything Gboard's own customize machinery expects from a valid toolbar entry is
 * exercised, including save, reload, and reorder.
 *
 * ## How it goes native
 *
 * The full mechanism is documented on {@link NativeToolbarButton}. Read end-to-end:
 *
 *  - **Allowed-set:** a `string-array` resource holds every id Gboard accepts on the bar. The
 *    write filter is the only filter we face; the save side keeps whatever is handed to it. So
 *    the win is registering under a *dormant* id that's already allowed but never built by
 *    Gboard. `flag_editor` is the one used here; there are six candidates and any of them
 *    works.
 *  - **The registry:** `Lmlh.h` is an `ArrayMap` keyed by id. Its `g(mic, true)` method writes
 *    the definition *and* folds the id into the shown order in one call.
 *  - **The wiring:** `mhx.q(Runnable)` wraps a plain `java.lang.Runnable` as an
 *    `ACCESS_POINT_ACTION` key-press, which the IME dispatcher runs natively on tap. The
 *    runnable lives in the extension (so nothing obfuscated is named from Java) and is
 *    constructed with no arguments — see {@link TestAction}.
 *
 * Click commits "test" at the cursor — that is the whole point of the button as a test: if
 * the text appears, the click dispatch reached the extension without us having hooked any of
 * Gboard's callbacks.
 *
 * <b>Default-off.</b> Exposed in the patch list so the flow can be verified on device before
 * this shape replaces the split-list splice everywhere else.
