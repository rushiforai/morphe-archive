/**
 * Makes the scrub engine's feel adjustable from Gboard's own settings.
 *
 * Every value in `Lpvr;`, the engine's tuning struct, is **`public final`** — Gboard writes them
 * only inside `Lpvr;-><init>`. So none of them can be set with an `iput` from a patch; ART rejects
 * a final-field write from outside the declaring class. The way in is to substitute the
 * **constructor arguments** instead, which is what this patch does.
 *
 * That turns out to be the better shape anyway. The hold delay was previously removed by editing
 * the activation test `p()` at runtime, and getting that edit wrong shipped a `VerifyError` that
 * bricked the keyboard. Substituting the value at construction touches no control flow in the
 * gesture path at all.
 *
 * Both edits are gated on the wildcard start keycode written by `swipeToDeletePatch`, so the
 * spacebar cursor drag and the inline-suggestion scrub keep their stock values. The
 * inline-suggestion handler additionally calls the four-argument constructor directly, so it never
 * even reaches the hold-delay substitution.
 *
 * See `docs/motion-event-handlers.md` for how the engine was derived.

 * Caps how many words one swipe can delete.
 *
 * `r()` turns the travelled distance into a **signed** count and dispatches it, and the consumer
 * deletes to match. Two sites produce that count — the in-table bucket walk and the past-the-table
 * extrapolation — and both are a multiply of a magnitude by the direction:
 *
 * ```
 * 106: mul-int/2addr v3, v7      # bucket index × direction        (opcode 0xb2)
 * 121: mul-int v3, v7, v0        # extrapolated magnitude × direction (opcode 0x92)
 * 123: if-nez v12, -> 135        # both converge here
 * 125: iget v0, v10, ->r:I       # the last count dispatched
 * 127: if-ne v0, v3, -> 135      # only re-dispatched when it changes
 * ```
 *
 * Clamping the count to ±N gives "at most N words per swipe" for free: swiping further produces a
 * raw count that clamps back to the same value, the comparison at 127 finds no change, and nothing
 * more is dispatched. Swiping back still reduces the magnitude, so restore keeps working.
 *
 * **Both sites are patched rather than the convergence at 123**, because 123 is a branch target:
 * dexlib2 keeps labels attached to the original instruction, so code inserted before it would be
 * jumped straight over by the two `goto`s that reach it — catching only the extrapolation path and
 * silently leaving the common one uncapped.
 *
 * The clamp must also land *before* offset 127. Clamping any later would leave the change detection
 * comparing a clamped `this.r` against an unclamped count, so every further pixel of travel would
 * re-dispatch the same value and delete another word — the exact opposite of the intent.
 *
 * The two multiply opcodes are asserted by name, which the `dis.py` caveat in `tools/apk/README.md`
 * otherwise warns against. It is safe here because the placeholders that tool prints encode the
 * opcode bytes directly — `binop2addrb2` is `0xb2` and `binop92` is `0x92` — and the Dalvik spec
 * fixes those as `mul-int/2addr` and `mul-int`.

 * consumes.
 *
 * Established by backward liveness across the whole method, not by reading forward from the
 * insertion point. That distinction is not pedantry: reading forward says v3 is free, because the
 * `add-int/lit8` at the head of the table walk writes it. It is **wrong**. The `if-gt` guarding the
 * walk branches straight past that write to the extrapolation path, which reads v3 as the previous
 * bucket's threshold — zero, on the first iteration, from the `const/4` above. Borrowing v3 would
 * have silently corrupted the extrapolated word count for swipes past the end of the table, on a
 * path that only fires for long swipes. Nothing would have crashed.
 *
 * At the delta subtraction, v6 through v9 are all genuinely dead on every path. Three are taken
 * here and v6 left alone, since the next instruction overwrites it anyway.

/**
 * Gives a swipe that started on the backspace key Gboard's own distance per word, undoing
 * [scaleStepTable] for that one case.
 *
 * ## Why a multiply rather than a second table
 *
 * [scaleStepTable] rewrites `Lpvs;->h:[F` in place at construction, so by the time `r()` walks the
 * table the stock thresholds are gone. Restoring them would mean keeping a copy and swapping which
 * array the walk reads — two arrays to maintain, and a field to swap them through.
 *
 * The arithmetic makes that unnecessary. The walk compares `|delta|` against the table, and the
 * table has been multiplied through by `scale/100`. Comparing `|delta| · scale/100` against
 * `T · scale/100` is the same test as comparing `|delta|` against `T`, so multiplying the delta by
 * the *same* factor exactly recovers the stock thresholds. One `mul-float`, no second array, and
 * `scaleStepTable` is left exactly as it was.
 *
 * It also means the cost falls on the case that is rarer for a Flexboard user: a swipe-anywhere
 * gesture does no extra arithmetic at all, because the table it walks is already the one it wants.
 *
 * ## Where it goes
 *
 * `Math.abs(F)F` is called exactly once in `r()`, and its `move-result` is the `|delta|` the walk
 * then consumes. Inserting immediately after it means the multiply lands after every path that
 * produces a delta and before every path that reads one, which is not something an offset could
 * promise.
 *
 * Reading the scale preference here rather than caching it mirrors [capWordCount], which already
 * reads `flexboard_max_words` from this same method on every event that produces a count. The store
 * resolves to a process-wide singleton over an in-memory map, so this is a lookup rather than I/O —
 * and doing it the same way as the code beside it is worth more than saving one of them.
