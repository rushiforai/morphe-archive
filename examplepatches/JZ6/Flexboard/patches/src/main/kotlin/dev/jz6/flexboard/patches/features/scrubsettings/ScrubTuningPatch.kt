/**
 * Makes the scrub engine's feel adjustable from Gboard's own settings.
 *
 * Every value in `Lpvr;`, the engine's tuning struct, is **`public final`** — Gboard writes them
 * only inside `Lpvr;-><init>`. So none of them can be set with an `iput` from a patch; ART rejects
 * a final-field write from outside the declaring class. The way in is to substitute the
 * **constructor arguments** instead, which is what this patch does.
 *
 * That turns out to be the better shape anyway. The hold delay was previously removed by editing
 * the activation test `p()` at runtime, and getting that edit wrong shipped a `VerifyError` that
 * bricked the keyboard. Substituting the value at construction touches no control flow in the
 * gesture path at all.
 *
 * Both edits are gated on the wildcard start keycode written by `swipeToDeletePatch`, so the
 * spacebar cursor drag and the inline-suggestion scrub keep their stock values. The
 * inline-suggestion handler additionally calls the four-argument constructor directly, so it never
 * even reaches the hold-delay substitution.
 *
 * See `docs/motion-event-handlers.md` for how the engine was derived.

 * Scales the distance table in place.

 * `r()` counts how many entries of `Lpvs;->h:[F` the travelled distance has passed, and that count

 * percentage is the whole knob. Unlike `Lpvr;`, the table field is not final, and array contents
 * are writable regardless, so this needs no constructor-argument substitution.
 *
 * Done in `ScrubDeleteMotionEventHandler.<init>` rather than the shared engine constructor because
 * the Context is still in a parameter register there — the engine constructor overwrites its own
 * Context register with `Resources` before the table is built.
 *
 * ## Why this one tests the sentinel
 *
 * Living in the delete constructor scopes it to delete, so it needs no sentinel test to avoid the
 * spacebar and inline-suggestion handlers. It tests one anyway, and is alone among the three in
 * having to: the other two run in the *shared* engine and so already gate on `Lpvs;->a:I` being
 * negative, which means turning Flexboard off silences them for free. Without its own copy of that
 * test this one would keep rescaling the distance of Gboard's own backspace swipe after the switch
 * was turned off — the one setting that would leak out of a disabled Flexboard.
 *
 * The gate branches to the same target the rest of the block uses, which is the instruction after
 * the super call: `return-void`. It reads no registers, so nothing there can be upset by the extra
 * edge.
 *
 * A positive scale preserves the strictly-increasing invariant the engine checks, so this cannot
 * trip the `Lpvs;->g:Z` bail-out. Where that flag is already set the table points at a *shared
 * static* fallback, so the scaling is skipped rather than corrupting global state.

/**
 * Caps how many words one swipe can delete.
 *
 * `r()` turns the travelled distance into a **signed** count and dispatches it, and the consumer
 * deletes to match. Two sites produce that count — the in-table bucket walk and the past-the-table
 * extrapolation — and both are a multiply of a magnitude by the direction:
 *
 * ```
 * 106: mul-int/2addr v3, v7      # bucket index × direction        (opcode 0xb2)
 * 121: mul-int v3, v7, v0        # extrapolated magnitude × direction (opcode 0x92)
 * 123: if-nez v12, -> 135        # both converge here
 * 125: iget v0, v10, ->r:I       # the last count dispatched
 * 127: if-ne v0, v3, -> 135      # only re-dispatched when it changes
 * ```
 *
 * Clamping the count to ±N gives "at most N words per swipe" for free: swiping further produces a
 * raw count that clamps back to the same value, the comparison at 127 finds no change, and nothing
 * more is dispatched. Swiping back still reduces the magnitude, so restore keeps working.
 *
 * **Both sites are patched rather than the convergence at 123**, because 123 is a branch target:
 * dexlib2 keeps labels attached to the original instruction, so code inserted before it would be
 * jumped straight over by the two `goto`s that reach it — catching only the extrapolation path and
 * silently leaving the common one uncapped.
 *
 * The clamp must also land *before* offset 127. Clamping any later would leave the change detection
 * comparing a clamped `this.r` against an unclamped count, so every further pixel of travel would
 * re-dispatch the same value and delete another word — the exact opposite of the intent.
 *
 * The two multiply opcodes are asserted by name, which the `dis.py` caveat in `tools/apk/README.md`
 * otherwise warns against. It is safe here because the placeholders that tool prints encode the
 * opcode bytes directly — `binop2addrb2` is `0xb2` and `binop92` is `0x92` — and the Dalvik spec
 * fixes those as `mul-int/2addr` and `mul-int`.
