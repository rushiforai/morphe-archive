/**
 * Gives keypresses Android's modern haptic primitives instead of a plain buzz.
 *
 * `Lpho;->f(I)V` is Gboard's vibrate call and it has two arms:
 *
 *  - **primitives** — `VibrationEffect.startComposition().addPrimitive(1, strength * 0.01)`, the
 *    crisp tick a Pixel uses everywhere else in the system
 *  - **legacy** — `VibrationEffect.createOneShot(duration, DEFAULT_AMPLITUDE)`, an undifferentiated
 *    buzz for a number of milliseconds
 *
 * Which arm runs is decided by `Lpho;->k(Vibrator)`, and that is three conditions:
 *
 * 1. `SDK_INT >= 30`
 * 2. `SDK_INT >= vibration_effect_min_sdk`
 * 3. `Vibrator.areAllEffectsSupported(...)` says the hardware can do it
 *
 * The flag in (2) ships as **1024**. No Android version is or will be 1024, so (2) can never hold
 * and the primitive arm is dead code on every device. This patch rewrites that literal to 30.
 *
 * ## Why this one is safe to force
 *
 * `docs/phenotype-flags.md` records the rule the expensive way: a flag revealing finished *local*
 * code is safe, a flag fronting server-*configured* machinery is not. This is as self-contained as
 * the rule gets — the code behind it is `android.os.VibrationEffect`, in the platform, on the
 * device. There is no model, no download, no allowlist and no consent.
 *
 * It is also the rare case where the **hardware check survives the patch**. Condition (3) is
 * Gboard asking the vibrator what it supports, and this patch does not touch it, so a device
 * without primitive support still takes the legacy arm. The worst outcome is that nothing changes.
 *
 * ## What it changes about the slider
 *
 * Worth knowing before turning it on, because it is not purely additive. On the legacy arm the
 * strength value is a **duration in milliseconds**. On the primitive arm the same value is scaled
 * by `0.01` and used as a primitive **intensity** — so the number behind the slider stops meaning
 * milliseconds. Gboard's own design, not something this patch introduces, but it means
 * [vibrationPatch]'s slider will feel differently calibrated once this is on.
 *
 * ## On by default
 *
 * The exception to "flags ship opt-in until watched working on a device", and it is worth saying
 * why rather than just doing it. That rule exists because a forced flag can open a gate onto
 * machinery a resigned build cannot supply — a downloaded model, a version allowlist, a server
 * handshake — and the failure mode is a keyboard that will not start.
 *
 * None of that applies here. The code behind the flag is `android.os.VibrationEffect`, already on
 * the device, and Gboard's own `areAllEffectsSupported` check is untouched by this patch, so
 * hardware that cannot do primitives keeps the legacy path. The worst outcome is that keypresses
 * feel the same as before.
 *
 * Still unverified on a device, which is a statement about the haptics feeling right, not about
 * whether the keyboard starts.
