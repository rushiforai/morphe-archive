 * which is worse, because it refuses a patch that is correct. That is not hypothetical: this walked
 * past a `goto -> 123` in `ScrubMotionEventHandler->r`, read the `add-int/2addr v2, v5` eleven
 * instructions later at pc 112 -- code that jump cannot reach -- and stopped Swipe Left to Delete
 * from applying at all, on a device.
 *
 * So the walk stops at the first instruction that transfers control. That instruction's own reads
 * still count: `if-eqz v5` reads v5.
 *
 * A pass proves nothing either way. The registers come from preflight's backward analysis over the
 * real control-flow graph, which the gate runs; this is the cheap copy that makes a build which
 * moved them fail at patch time too.
