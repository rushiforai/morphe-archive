 * before reading any of them. The two branches the finish path can still take — the empty-text exit
 * and the no-`Lftq;` exit — both join the epilogue without reading v2 or v3 first.
 *
 * The epilogue *does* read v4 (the handled flag), v9 (`this`), v10 (the return value) and v12, so
 * none of those may be touched.
 *
 * **Re-derived for Gboard 18, not carried over.** The dispatcher dropped from 36 to 34 registers,

 * one of those steps is a name or a register that R8 re-rolls on each Gboard build. Undo is
 * strictly additive (swiping right did nothing before this patch existed) and Gboard fills the undo

 *
 * | member | siblings with the same signature |
 * |---|---|
 * | re-commit | `s` and `t` on `AbstractIme`, both `(L…;Z)V`, both empty stubs on the base |
 * | available | `d`, `m`, `n` on the slot, all `()Z` |
 * | clear | nine `()V` methods on the slot |
 * | slot field | resolved with the slot type, so it cannot name a stale one |
 *
 * `0.0.3-dev.1` shipped the first of those wrong: it called `s`, which existed, verified and ran,
 * and silently did nothing. The other three were the same accident waiting to happen.
 *
 * ## The anchor
 *
 * The re-commit is matched by *shape* — `AbstractIme->…(L…;Z)V` — which occurs exactly once in the
 * whole 1,544-instruction dispatcher, so it needs no name to find. Everything else is then located
 * relative to it by register: the receiver of the `Optional` getter is the slot, and the field that
 * loaded that register is where the slot lives.
