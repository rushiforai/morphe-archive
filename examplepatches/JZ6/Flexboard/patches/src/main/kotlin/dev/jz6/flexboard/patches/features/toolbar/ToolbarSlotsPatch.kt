/**
 * Widens Gboard's toolbar allowed-id set with Flexboard's button ids.
 *
 * Gboard reads exactly one resource — the string array at `0x7f0300dc` — into the immutable id
 * set both halves of admission consult: the bar controller folds newly-registered ids into the
 * shown list only if the set contains them (`Lmlh.g`), and the saved order keeps only ids the
 * set contains on read (`Lmjv.c`). Everything about reorder and persistence stays stock because
 * nothing dex-side is touched. The mechanism, the trace and the alternatives are written up in
 * `docs/toolbar-access-points.md`.
 *
 * On its own this patch is inert: the ids admitted here draw nothing unless another patch
 * registers an access point under the same id — names without a registry entry are skipped at
 * render (`Lmlh.w` does a map lookup and drops misses). The consumers arrive with the hotkey
 * patches.
 *
 * Unnamed on purpose: nothing about it is user-meaningful alone, and a "Toolbar Slots" tickbox
 * would invite deselecting a dependency the hotkey patches can never actually exclude
 * (they `dependsOn` it). It runs whenever a consumer is selected, and never on its own.
