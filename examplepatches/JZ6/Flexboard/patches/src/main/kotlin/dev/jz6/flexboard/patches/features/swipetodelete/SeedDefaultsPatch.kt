/**
 * Writes Flexboard's starting values into Gboard's preference file on the first run.
 *
 * ## Why a write rather than a default
 *
 * Every other value in this project takes effect as the fallback operand of a preference read
 * emitted into Gboard's bytecode: the number lives in the patch, and an unset preference picks it
 * up. Three literals would have done this the same way.
 *
 * The reason not to is that such a default follows the code. Change it in a later release and it
 * moves every user who never touched the slider — someone who has spent a month with a keyboard
 * finds it different after an update they did not ask for. Writing once inverts that: the first run
 * after installing decides, the value becomes an ordinary stored preference indistinguishable from
 * one the user set, and later releases can pick different starting numbers for new installs without
 * disturbing anyone.
 *
 * ## Why this is one instruction
 *
 * The extension has been able to write preferences all along — it is how the settings screen stores
 * a slider, in plain Java with no bytecode involved. So the patch does not need to reach a setter
 * on Gboard's store at all. It hands the extension a `Context` and gets out of the way; see
 * `Defaults`, and `Preferences` for why the file that `Context` resolves to is the subtle part.
 *
 * Doing it in smali would have meant deriving a string-keyed setter and reusing the `getInt` whose
 * two same-signature siblings on that class are a documented trap — for the same result.
 *
 * ## The insertion
 *
 * `LatinApp.applyPreferenceValues` runs at Application start, before any keyboard is built and so
 * before any of these values is read. `suggestedSettingsPatch` and `forceScrubPreferencesPatch` already
 * insert here for the same reason.
 *
 * `p0` is the `LatinApp` itself, an `Application` and therefore a `Context`, so the argument needs
 * no lookup and nothing obfuscated crosses into Java. With `registerCount` 13 and two parameter
 * words it lands in v11, inside the four-bit register field a `35c` invoke can encode — emitting a
 * `pN` an invoke cannot address is what produced an unappliable bundle once before, so the check
 * below is not ceremony. See `docs/register-encoding.md`.
 *
 * **No register is written.** The insertion reads a parameter and calls a static, which is why it
 * needs no liveness proof and why it cannot interact with the other two insertions at this same
 * entry whatever order they apply in.
