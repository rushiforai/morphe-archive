/**
 * The extension call the emission makes instead of raising a Gboard event.
 *
 * Round one deleted a character, which was unmistakable and also ate text — and a deletion is a
 * poor signal anyway, since it is what a mis-fired scrub looks like too. Typing a marker through
 * `InputConnection.commitText` is clearer and non-destructive.
 *
 * Dispatching a printable character through Gboard's own event stream would have been the obvious
 * change and is the wrong one: a printable key travels as a keycode plus a `String` payload whose
 * convention I could not establish from the dex without guessing, and a wrong guess does not fail
 * loudly. It dispatches an event nothing consumes, which is indistinguishable from the gesture
 * never firing — a false negative in the one measurement this patch exists to take.

/**
 * **Temporary. Delete this file once the question it answers is answered.**
 *
 * *Swipe up to undo autocorrect* does nothing on a device, and "does nothing" has two very different
 * causes that look identical from the outside:
 *
 *  1. the gesture is never recognised — the emission runs, but SLIDE_UP is not what the direction
 *     comes back as, or the `ActionDef` is not null, or the corridor rejects the swipe; or
 *  2. the gesture is recognised and dispatches correctly, and the **revert itself** is the no-op,
 *     because Gboard had nothing armed to revert.
 *
 * Nothing in the gate can tell those apart. There is no Android SDK here, so no patch is ever
 * executed locally, and the emission has no way to report anything from a phone.
 *
 * So this is the same patch with one operand changed: identical anchor, identical guards, and a
 * backspace where the revert keycode was. Install it instead of the real patch and swipe up over a
 * letter.
 *
 * **A character disappears** — the whole chain works: gesture, guards, event construction and
 * dispatch. The fault is downstream, in the revert being unarmed, and the fix is the one-slot
 * capture-and-restore rather than anything about the gesture.
 *
 * **Nothing happens** — the chain fails before dispatch.
 *
 * Round one ran with all three guards and nothing happened. This is round two, with only the
 * direction test left. Because the null-ActionDef guard is gone, a flick on a key that *does* define
 * an upward action now deletes a character instead of inserting that key's symbol — deliberate, and
 * another reason this file is temporary.
 *
 * Do not enable this alongside *Swipe up to undo autocorrect*. Both attach to the same instruction
 * in `Lpvf;->t`, and selecting both emits two guards at one anchor: a swipe would delete a
 * character *and* dispatch a revert. Morphe has no way to declare that two patches are mutually
 * exclusive, so this paragraph is the only thing preventing it.
