/**
 * Widens Gboard's toolbar allowed-id set with Flexboard's button ids.
 *
 * Gboard reads exactly one resource — the string array at `0x7f0300dc` — into the immutable id
 * set both halves of admission consult: the bar controller folds newly-registered ids into the
 * shown list only if the set contains them (`Lmlh.g`), and the saved order keeps only ids the
 * set contains on read (`Lmjv.c`). Everything about reorder and persistence stays stock because
 * nothing dex-side is touched. The mechanism, the trace and the alternatives are written up in
 * `docs/toolbar-access-points.md`.
 *
 * On its own this patch is inert: the ids admitted here draw nothing unless another patch
 * registers an access point under the same id — names without a registry entry are skipped at
 * render (`Lmlh.w` does a map lookup and drops misses). Both toolbar patches are consumers, and
 * either one selected alone admits the other's ids too, which costs a few array members that
 * nothing draws.
 *
 * Unnamed on purpose: nothing about it is user-meaningful alone, and a tickbox for it would
 * invite deselecting a dependency its consumers can never actually exclude (they `dependsOn`
 * it). It runs whenever one of them is selected, and never on its own.
