## Done from the queue

- **"redo settings to use native gboard"** (1.4.0-dev, after dev.2): the settings screen is hosted
  by Gboard's own settings stack — the row's `android:fragment` instantiates an extension fragment
  subclassing `CommonPreferenceFragment` (compile-only stub; see `stubs/`), the screen is a real
  `res/xml/flexboard_settings.xml` of `InlineSliderPreference` rows, and values persist through the
  datastore bridge into the same store the swipe patch reads. The hand-built Activity, its theme
  mirroring and the rename-patch retarget are deleted; old int-typed keys abandoned for
  `flexboard_swipe_*`. Mechanism and pins: [`docs/gboard-settings-hosting.md`](gboard-settings-hosting.md).

## Historical: the dead merge-splice architecture (kept for context)

Under "Formerly broken / solved by native registration": the old design tried to splice extra
buttons into the split-method list and hand-merge them against `access_points_showing_order` in
`ToolbarMerge.merge`. It never landed ordering right, crashed the 4-square customize overflow
(persistence write couldn't see unregistered ids), and snapped buttons back to the front on
every rebuild. All of that is deleted; native registration via `emitNativeToolbarButtons` is
the only way in.

**Summary of the pre-native findings (the 'fix X' series that was wrong-headed):**
- "ToolbarMerge previously fought itself: merged-by-pairs-approach produced duplicates and drift" — fixed by deleting ToolbarMerge.
- "Hotkey.labelAt returns '' / hasContent / hotkeySlotOf" — fixed by deleting Hotkey.
- "`addInstructionsWithLabels` chokes on two sequential insertions" — still true; emission is label-free everywhere.
- "?attr/colorControlNormal does not resolve at recompile time" — still true; don't use AppCompat attrs.
- "The settings Activity should render only enabled sections via markers" — deferred by user.

## Pending (investigated, needs implementation)

**Bigger Toolbar returns natively.** Hotkeys have since shipped — six slots on `flexboard_*` ids
admitted by `toolbarIdAdmissionPatch`. Bigger Toolbar has not. Both previous attempts tried to own
the count and both broke the user's ability to remove buttons; the plan that follows from that is
`docs/toolbar-capacity.md`, and it raises the capacity only.

**Widen the allowed-set array when hotkeys return.** Done — `toolbarIdAdmissionPatch` splices the
twelve `flexboard_hotkey_N` ids into the allowed-set array via `res/values` (strings + items),
zero dex change; research in [`docs/toolbar-access-points.md`](toolbar-access-points.md). Inert
until a patch registers those ids — which is the hotkeys return, when it comes.

**Rolled back: the 1.4.0-dev.1–dev.5 native hotkeys.** The dex side was solid (conditional
`Lmlh` blocks + the `Lmjv;->c` order-filter bypass), but the feature's per-slot ListPreference
screens needed two string-array entries in `res/values/`, and values-file surgery failed twice
inside Morphe's encode: once from arsclib minting a fake type out of the filename
(`flexboard_hotkey_icons.xml` → type `flexboard_hotkey_icon`), once from a splice that left a
second `<resources>` opening tag mid-file (parse died at `arrays.xml` line 7141). The whole
stack was reset to the pre-hotkeys base. When hotkeys re-land: keep the dex half, and serve
the slot pickers **without touching `res/values/`** — hardcode the icon choices in the
extension's Java and build the lists at runtime.

**Re-landed in 1.4.0-dev.4** on the widened allowed-set array instead of the filter bypass:
extension core (`499af89`), registration + settings rows (`fc80d12`) — count slider,
twelve inline text EditText rows, label/labelOf fixes and trailing-nop carried over — and the
import/export blob row (`3ba0de6`), later replaced by real Export/Import buttons. Slot icons
default from the bundled-glyph table and are user-changeable again, wired through the ported
click hook (`aA`) that finally exists. The ui went through two passes: first tap-to-cycle rows
(superseded — user feedback), then the current **picker grid dialog** off the tapped row's own
activity context, with export/import as a show-the-blob / paste-the-blob popup pair.
`IconListPreference` was skipped deliberately: its icon list arrives through the extras *Bundle*,
which no XML inflater in the port populates.

Device note, resolved in dev.5: slots also re-register from the toolbar module's start-input
callback (`Lmln.fn`), so a settings edit takes effect when the keyboard next opens. The
constructor emission stays as the session seed. (The count slider went away too: slots ship as
numbered placeholders, clear-text to hide.)



## Native registration (being proven out — Parked)

The "Pending (investigated, needs implementation)" section above named the right goal but
mis-diagnosed the seam: the "registered-provider" route isn't needed. Follow-up tracing of the
order-write path confirms the save side (`Lmjz;->q`) writes whatever list it is handed with no
filtering; the **only** filter is on read — `Lmjv;->c` drops ids not in the allowed-set.

That set is the string-array resource `0x7f0300dc`, read once into `mku.c`. Six ids in it are
dormant — zero dex code references them: `flag_editor`, `editor_info`,
`muse_toggle_playground_ap`, `jetson_feedback`, `undo_cooperative`, `signboard_education`.
Borrowing one of them means: the read filter accepts it, the save path keeps it, and Customize
renders it as a fully capable draggable entry.

The bar controller `Lmlh` has `h: ArrayMap<String, mic>` — the actual AP registry. Calling
`mlh.g(mic, true)` on it both stores the definition *and* folds the id into the shown order via
the order manager. `mjv.n(ctx, mxf, h, c, extras)` then re-folds `extras` on every rebuild, so
the button survives orientation/fold changes.

The **Toolbar Native Test** patch (removed once it had served its purpose) did this: hooked the
`Lmlh.<init>` tail, built an
`mic` with id `flag_editor`, icon from stock, a literal "Test" label, and a click-runnable that
committed "test" at the cursor via a small extension action. It worked on device, and the same
shape becomes the long-term home for Text Actions + Hotkeys (each `g(...)s` its own id(s) into
`h`), and `ToolbarMerge` shrinks back to "read the order string to seed the shown order"
rather than the current half-broken injection.

## The generalisation: NativeToolbarButton + emitNativeToolbarButtons

After the test button proved out on device, the shape was promoted into a shared helper at
`patches/shared/ToolbarHotkeys.kt`:

- **`NativeToolbarButton`** — a spec carrying id / icon / label (res-or-literal) / optional
  contentDescription / an actionCtor (`"Ldev/.../T;-><init>(... )V"`) plus `actionArgs`
  (`const/4`-`const/16` ordinals).
- **`emitNativeToolbarButtons(builder, buttons)`** — resolves the bar-controller class (via the
  split-method anchor), resolves the register call by shape (the unique `(ApType, Z)V` that
  `Lays.put`s into `h`), asserts the constructor register count, and emits one block per button
  at the `<init>` tail.

Any future toolbar feature consumes it as `emitNativeToolbarButtons(builder, listOf(...))` and
never thinks about hook sites, `Builders`, or the allowed-set — picking from the dormant ids
below. `ToolbarNativeTestPatch` was a 30-line call into the helper, and was deleted once
Text Action Buttons and Toolbar Hotkeys had both proven the mechanism in production.

A checker convention flows from this: the spec's `actionCtor` has to be a `const val` in the
patch file, full member-descriptor form; `check_shared_constants.py` then treats each as if
`invoke-direct` on a real extension class and verifies it against the actual Java source. The
checker was also fixed to strip Kotlin comments before scanning — KDoc references to extension
members were firing the "silently stopped checking" guard.

## Replaced: the legacy merge splice

The split-method list splice that used to implement toolbar insertion is gone:

- `TextActionsPatch.kt` (three buttons emitted into `Lmlh;->C(List)V`) **deleted** — superseded
  by `ToolbarButtonsPatch.kt`, which registers the same three buttons at the `<init>` tail using
  its own admitted ids.
- `CustomHotkeysPatch.kt` **deleted** — the 12-slot hotkeys feature hung off the same merge
  registry and will come back as native registration with its own ids (three dormant ids remain
  for this — plus `jetson_feedback` and `signboard_education` — and if twelve are needed we
  will have to widen the `0x7f0300dc` array, which is one ARSC patch).
- `ToolbarMerge.java` and `emitToolbarMergeCall` **deleted** — no more order-string pair merge.
  Reordering now lands in Gboard's own Customize UI; the bar rebuild path reads the resulting
  order string as-is. The merge class was doing work Customize already knows how to do.
- `BasePatch` no longer emits the merge call.

The dormant allowed-set ids, none of which Flexboard uses any more:

| id                          | status                                        |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `editor_info`               | the sentinel `toolbarIdAdmissionPatch` finds the array by |
| `undo_cooperative`          | free                                          |
| `muse_toggle_playground_ap` | free                                          |
| `jetson_feedback`           | free                                          |
| `signboard_education`       | free                                          |

The text action buttons squatted on the first three until they moved to their own admitted ids
(`flexboard_select_all`, `flexboard_copy`, `flexboard_paste`), the same way the hotkey slots
always did. `editor_info` is still load-bearing, but only as a landmark: the allowed-set array's
name is obfuscated per build, so the splice locates it by looking for a member it knows.

Old prefs on users' devices (`flexboard_select_all` etc. in `mlh.h`, and hotkey values in the
user's shared-prefs) are orphaned by the swap; neither breaks anything — the old ids drop out
of the order filter silently, and hotkey fields in the settings screen are inert until the
hotkey patch returns in native form.

## Pending (investigated, needs implementation)

**Toolbar reorder persistence — register as providers.** Gboard's customize-write path reconstructs the saved order string from the registered-provider list — the `Lmjv`/`Lmjz` order hierarchy — and drops any id it doesn't know. Our injected buttons (`flexboard_select_all`, `flexboard_copy`, `flexboard_paste`, `flexboard_hotkey_N`) aren't providers, so they never appear in the order string, and every customize session forgets them. On rebuild, `merge()` can only place them canonicallly at the front (which is why it currently always does that — see `ToolbarMerge.mergeOrdered`). To fix: register our access points with Gboard's provider machinery via a bytecode patch, instead of injecting into the bar's rendered list after the fact. Then the customize-write path has them by construction, and drag-persistence just works.

**Toolbar crash on clicking the 4-square overflow icon.** Reproduces as a crash depending on state; likely the icons where a draw with our registered ids into Customize's key paths. Needs a device logcat to identify. Likely related to not persisting: the customize view expects reordable ids, ours are absent, and the difference in list contents likely crashes the section/commit handler with an unexpected value.

## Parked: grey out settings rows for un-ticked patches

Replaces the older "conditional settings sections" idea (dead: re-deriving patch selection at
build time; shared-file finalize ordering between patches would be a new, unproven assumption;
checkers would have to weaken their exact row sets). **This design keeps the static screen and
verifies everything statically — the only runtime question is which probe says a feature is in.**

Why it was kicked down the road in Aug 2026: worth doing, not urgent — the only always-visible
inert row today is the swipe slider, and the hotkeys block *works* even with its engine unticked
(it accumulates prefs that go live on a later tick).

**Step 1 — how the screen knows what was patched in (per feature):**

- *Hotkeys: free probe, zero patch code.* `toolbarIdAdmissionPatch` splices `flexboard_hotkey_N`
  strings into resources, so `getIdentifier("flexboard_hotkey_1", "string", pkg) != 0` at
  runtime == hotkeys are in the APK. Nothing to write, nothing to stale.
- *Swipe (and anything without a resource probe): store marker.* The feature patch seeds
  `flexboard_feature_swipe=1` from the app-start hook (the `SeedDefaultsPatch` shape: one
  fingerprint-anchored call into an extension writer). Known caveat: repatching *without* the
  feature leaves the marker behind (prefs survive). Parked decision: acceptable on the dev
  channel; if it ever matters, version the marker value with a build stamp.

**Step 2 — what "greyed" renders as (two tiers):**

- *Tier 1 — text-disabled, zero new dex surface:* the existing first-tap sync pass
  (`FlexboardSettingsFragment.syncRowIconsOnce`, post-popup-build version) also reads the
  probes; rows whose feature is absent get a summary like "needs the Swipe Left to Delete patch"
  and `aA` short-circuits them (still returns true — no dialog, no cycle). No new pinned
  letters, fragment already falls through `d()` nulls safely. ~40 extension lines + the marker
  seed; checker contract untouched (rows always exist).
- *Tier 2 — visual disable:* `setEnabled(false)` on the port — findable the way `n`/`N` were
  (`performClick`'s `ac()Z` reads the enabled field; the letter writing it is one `(... Z)V`
  away). Adds exactly one preflight pin. Real grey, at the cost of a bind-flash: rows look
  enabled from inflation until the first sync pass, because the port offers no row-bind hook
  the stub can override (same staleness story as the icons — accepted there too).

Do NOT weaken the checker lanes to build this: the row-count pin and key-family rules keep exact
sets; greyness is a runtime decision read off properties that don't touch the XML.

Trigger to revisit Tier 2 or conditional sections for real: the screen collecting several more
always-visible sections, or a feature whose inert rows actively mislead (user moves a slider,
nothing happens, no hint why).

## Earlier observations to not lose

- `ToolbarMerge` previously fought itself: merged-by-pairs-approach produced duplicates and drift. Simplified to: always prepend, never read the order.
- `Hotkey.labelAt` now returns "" instead of `null` when empty; `Hotkey.hasContent` and `hotkeySlotOf` in the merge filter empties from the register path. Empty slots must not reach the bar.
- `?attr/colorControlNormal` does not resolve at recompile time; use framework attrs (`android:textColorPrimary`) or hard colors.
- The icon `$0x7f...` in the hotkeys array needs nothing from the listed modes — they stay bundled in the APK and are just unused.
- morphe-patcher's `addInstructionsWithLabels` (label-aware smali insertion) chokes on two sequential insertions into one method if labels are involved (`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: length=0`). The fix is to remove labels from the inserted bytecode entirely (avoid `if-eqz`-generated `:absent` chains); branchless smali survives.
- The settings Activity should render only enabled sections via markers — parked pending a decision; user's roadmap entry says "hotkeys and toolbar config still in flexboard settings when they arent patched; settings should only be added with the patches".


## Shipped

The list above is kept as written; this notes which of it has landed, rather than pruning it.

- **update settings to match rest of gboard** — the screen inherits Gboard's own settings theme, so
  the colours follow it including Material You, and the metrics match androidx preference rows.
- **can we make the backspace swipe work as before without being limited to max 1 word delete** — a
  swipe starting on the backspace key keeps Gboard's distance per word and is not capped.
- **increased tool bar size fit more buttons** — *Bigger Toolbar*, raise-only slider for the
    bar's capacity (the max Gboard allows before pushing to overflow). Stock is five, which is
    fewer than the nine ids Flexboard already admits. The plan is `docs/toolbar-capacity.md`: two
    immediates, raising the flag default and the `[3, 8]` clamp it is measured against, and
    **no count override and no preference writes** — the count stays the user's. Also covers
    **max tool icon slider isnt working**.

- **tool bar amount used to be different between inner and outer screen of a fold** — covered
    natively, and for free: Gboard already branches the count preference by device class
    (`foldable_access_points_count_on_bar` vs `access_points_count_on_bar`) inside `Lmku;->b(I)I`,
    and the capacity plan raises the ceiling both are measured against without writing either. Each
    screen keeps its own count, set through Gboard's own UI.

- **add select all copy paste hotkeys** — *Text Editing Buttons* puts one-tap **Select all**,
  **Copy** and **Paste** on the toolbar. Cut is not built; it is the same shape again, one entry in
  a list. The icons turned out to be free: Gboard bundles Material's set and draws none of them, and
  `tools/apk/glyphs.py` finds them by geometry now that every drawable name is stripped.

- **Hot keys as new tool bar objects** — six slots under **Hotkeys** in Flexboard's settings, each
  typing whatever string you put in it. A slot you have not filled in builds no button at all, so
  they cost nothing until used and clearing a field removes the button again. The label on each is
  your own text: the access point carries a label *resource id* and a label *String*, and returns
  the String whenever the id is zero — and a sweep found nothing outside one accessor reading that
  id, so setting it to zero cannot break a rendering path.

  The toolbar slider was assumed to be a prerequisite, on the grounds that adding buttons only
  helps if there is room. That turned out to be wrong, which was lucky at the time, because the
  slider did not work. A new button is prepended to the ordered list the bar is built from, so it
  takes the first slot and pushes whatever used to be last into the overflow panel — no extra room
  needed. With the slider working the two now compose properly: raise the count and the button
  costs nothing that used to be visible.

- **set new defaults, swipe length 60%, icons on the toolbar 6, icons when unfolded 12** — all
  three, and **written into the store on first run** rather than baked into the patch as read
  fallbacks. That distinction is the point: a fallback follows the code, so changing it later moves
  everyone who never touched a slider. A written value is yours from the first run, and a future
  release can pick different starting numbers for new installs without touching a keyboard someone
  has got used to. The toolbar had no starting value at all before — unset fell through to whatever
  Gboard computed.

- **what other material symbols are there, im pretty sure undo exists** — it does not. All 2,170
  published Material Icons were matched against the APK's 496 vector drawables, and 29 shapes are
  bundled at 35 ids; the table is in [`gboard-bindings.md`](gboard-bindings.md#material-icons-gboard-bundles).
  `undo`, `redo`, `search`, `send`, `add`, `edit` and every numbered glyph match nothing, while
  `spellcheck` and `auto_awesome` are there. The hotkey icons were picked out of that list, which is
  also why they are shapes rather than the digits one through six. The `glyphs.py` tail check was
  fixed — it had been bleeding into the next `<path>` element and skipping filled icons, so
  `add`, `close`, `content_paste`, `delete`, `edit`, `mic`, `search` and `send` all reported
  "0 points" and were silently absent from earlier audits.

On **gesture down on a to select all**: not built, and deliberately not. It is the same action
reached a different way, and the toolbar button was the cheaper half. Gboard's own long-press
popups are defined in compiled keyboard metadata rather than in code, so putting an action there
means hooking the soft-key bind path and rewriting that metadata at runtime — a much larger change
than the one access-point insertion this took.
