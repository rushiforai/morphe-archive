# Roadmap

Ideas, in no particular order and with no promises. Kept verbatim as written.

turn the flick down for symbols patch into a "suggested settings patch", and turn on touch hold keys for symbols, turn off dont suggest offensive words, turn off word suggestions

get the whole list of icons shipped with gboard, pretty sure undo is there and used by the undo button

swipe length seem to be reversed? lower value takes more swipe to swipe multiple words on the delete key

what other material symbols are there, im pretty sure undo exists

update settings to match rest of gboard

some settings disabled like grammer check and ai writing tools, rambler mode etc

max tool icon slider isnt working, i dont see amount of tools changing

flick up to undo autocorrect 

Hot keys as new tool bar objects

gesture down on a to select all

tool bar amount used to be different between inner and outer screen of a fold

use graph 6 material icon for fleksy settings

increased tool bar size fit more buttons

## Shipped

The list above is kept as written; this notes which of it has landed, rather than pruning it.

- **update settings to match rest of gboard** — the screen inherits Gboard's own settings theme, so
  the colours follow it including Material You, and the metrics match androidx preference rows.
- **can we make the backspace swipe work as before without being limited to max 1 word delete** — a
  swipe starting on the backspace key keeps Gboard's distance per word and is not capped.
- **increased tool bar size fit more buttons** — *Bigger Toolbar*, a 3–12 slider for the number of
  icons on the access points bar. Shipped in `1.1.0-dev.1` and did nothing, withheld in
  `1.1.0-dev.2`, rebuilt against the right target: it had been raising the bar's *capacity*, which
  the count is computed from but not bound by. The count itself is now overridden, above both of the
  gates that were discarding the capacity. Also covers **max tool icon slider isnt working**.

- **tool bar amount used to be different between inner and outer screen of a fold** — it was, and
  the first cut of *Bigger Toolbar* flattened it: Gboard picks its count preference by device class,
  a fold changes class when it opens, and overriding at entry returned before that choice. There are
  now two sliders, the second applying only while unfolded and falling back to the first.

- **add select all copy paste hotkeys** — *Text Editing Buttons* puts one-tap **Select all**,
  **Copy** and **Paste** on the toolbar. Cut is not built; it is the same shape again, one entry in
  a list. The icons turned out to be free: Gboard bundles Material's set and draws none of them, and
  `tools/apk/glyphs.py` finds them by geometry now that every drawable name is stripped.

- **Hot keys as new tool bar objects** — six slots under **Hotkeys** in Flexboard's settings, each
  typing whatever string you put in it. A slot you have not filled in builds no button at all, so
  they cost nothing until used and clearing a field removes the button again. The label on each is
  your own text: the access point carries a label *resource id* and a label *String*, and returns
  the String whenever the id is zero — and a sweep found nothing outside one accessor reading that
  id, so setting it to zero cannot break a rendering path.

  The toolbar slider was assumed to be a prerequisite, on the grounds that adding buttons only
  helps if there is room. That turned out to be wrong, which was lucky at the time, because the
  slider did not work. A new button is prepended to the ordered list the bar is built from, so it
  takes the first slot and pushes whatever used to be last into the overflow panel — no extra room
  needed. With the slider working the two now compose properly: raise the count and the button
  costs nothing that used to be visible.

- **set new defaults, swipe length 60%, icons on the toolbar 6, icons when unfolded 12** — all
  three, and **written into the store on first run** rather than baked into the patch as read
  fallbacks. That distinction is the point: a fallback follows the code, so changing it later moves
  everyone who never touched a slider. A written value is yours from the first run, and a future
  release can pick different starting numbers for new installs without touching a keyboard someone
  has got used to. The toolbar had no starting value at all before — unset fell through to whatever
  Gboard computed.

- **what other material symbols are there, im pretty sure undo exists** — it does not. All 2,170
  published Material Icons were matched against the APK's 496 vector drawables, and 29 shapes are
  bundled at 35 ids; the table is in [`gboard-bindings.md`](gboard-bindings.md#material-icons-gboard-bundles).
  `undo`, `redo`, `search`, `send`, `add`, `edit` and every numbered glyph match nothing, while
  `spellcheck` and `auto_awesome` are there. The hotkey icons were picked out of that list, which is
  also why they are shapes rather than the digits one through six.

On **gesture down on a to select all**: not built, and deliberately not. It is the same action
reached a different way, and the toolbar button was the cheaper half. Gboard's own long-press
popups are defined in compiled keyboard metadata rather than in code, so putting an action there
means hooking the soft-key bind path and rewriting that metadata at runtime — a much larger change
than the one access-point insertion this took.
