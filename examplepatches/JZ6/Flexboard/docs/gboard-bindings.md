# Gboard bindings

Every obfuscated name this project depends on, what it is, and how it was identified. These are
facts about **one build**, and `COMPATIBILITY_GBOARD` pins the bundle to it precisely so a
different Gboard is refused rather than mispatched.

Kept as a document as well as in `GboardBindings.kt` because the derivation is the expensive part
and does not survive in code.

## The 17.7.7 → 18.0.3 move

The bundle now targets `18.0.3.954559732-release-arm64-v8a`. **The tables below the mapping are
still written in 17.7.7's names**, because that is the build their derivations were performed
against and rewriting them wholesale would mean asserting mappings that were never checked. Only
the names in this table were re-derived; anything else here needs re-deriving before it is trusted
on 18.

R8 renames on every build, so none of this carries over by assumption. Each row was matched
structurally — identical field letters and types, identical method shapes, identical instruction
bodies — not by guessing that the alphabet shifted.

| What it is | 17.7.7 | 18.0.3 |
|---|---|---|
| Preference store | `Lpnp;` | `Lqhy;` |
| Scrub config | `Lpbv;` | `Lpvs;` |
| Scrub timings | `Lpbu;` | `Lpvr;` |
| Keyboard delegate | `Lpbr;` | `Lpvo;` |
| Event | `Lnbj;` | `Lnur;` |
| Key/action data | `Loud;` | `Lpnu;` |
| …its second ctor arg | `Louc;` | `Lpnt;` |
| Scrub state / undo text source | `Lnsz;` | `Lomu;` |
| Undo slot | `Lqcy;` | `Lqyc;` |
| Committable text | `Lnpx;` | `Lojt;` |
| Signature check | `Lqvi;` | `Lrpv;` |
| …its fallback flag | `Lquk;` | `Lrox;` |

| Member | 17.7.7 | 18.0.3 |
|---|---|---|
| Event dispatcher | `LatinIme->d(Lnbj;)Z` | `LatinIme->q(Lnur;)Z` |
| Suppression flag | `AbstractIme->N:Z` | **`AbstractIme->O:Z`** |
| Store singleton | `Lpnp;->N(Context)` | `Lqhy;->I(Context)` |
| Preference writer | `Lpnp;->aa(I,Object)V` | `Lqhy;->T(I,Object)V` |
| `contains` by id | `Lpnp;->ar(I)Z` | `Lqhy;->ak(I)Z` |
| Word-count getter | `La;->W(Lnbj;)I` | `La;->X(Lnur;)I` |

**`AbstractIme->N:Z` → `O:Z` is the dangerous one.** Gboard 18 inserted a field, shifting every
letter from `C` down by one — and `N` still exists on 18 as an unrelated boolean. Carrying the
letter over would have assembled, passed verification and silently tested the wrong field, which no
type assertion can catch. It is pinned from a read count instead: the suppression flag is the only
`AbstractIme` boolean read exactly four times in the dispatcher, in both builds.

Unchanged across the move, and worth knowing because they carry most of the load:
`ScrubMotionEventHandler` and its `g`/`r`/`<init>` names, `AbstractMotionEventHandler->o:Context`,
`AbstractIme->B:Context`, `AbstractIme->s`, `LatinIme->y`, `Lpvs;->a`/`g`/`h`, and the store's
string-keyed `b`/`k`. The two signing-certificate digests are also identical, so
`COMPATIBILITY_GBOARD.signatures` needed no edit.

Resource ids all moved: `enable_scrub_delete` `0x7f140995`→`0x7f140a1f`, `enable_gesture_input`
`0x7f14097b`→`0x7f140a05`, `pref_enable_flick_symbols` `0x7f140977`→`0x7f140a01`.

## Touch and dispatch

| Binding | Signature | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Pointer tracker | `Lpbl;` | Owns a finger. Where the gesture is observed. |
| — movement | `Lpbl;->B(Lcom/google/android/libraries/inputmethod/widgets/SoftKeyView;FFJI)V` | `p1` is the soft key under the finger, **`p2`/`p3` are pointer x/y**. `registers=21`. |
| — cancel | `Lpbl;->s(J)V` | Pointer cancelled. |
| — reset | `Lpbl;->C()V` | Pointer state reset. |
| — anchor | `Lpbl;->ac()V` | Call site upstream uses as an insertion anchor inside the movement method. |
| Gesture dispatcher | `Lpbj;` | Turns a pointer into a key press. |
| — dispatch | `Lpbj;->f(Lpbl;Loth;Loud;Lowd;JZZIZJI)V` | `p1` is the tracker, which is what lets a veto match a press to the gesture that consumed it. |
| — delegate field | `Lpbj;->o:Lpbh;` | |
| — delegate call | `Lpbh;->o(Lpbl;Loth;Loud;Lowd;JZZIZJI)V` | What the stock dispatch forwards to. |
| Soft key view | `Lcom/google/android/libraries/inputmethod/widgets/SoftKeyView;` | Not obfuscated. |

Note the frame of `Lpbl;->B` — 21 registers, 7 parameter words — is the one that makes
`p2` resolve to `v16`. See [`register-encoding.md`](register-encoding.md).

## Preferences

| Binding | Signature | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Store | `Lpnp;` | `public final`, extends `Lcbv;`. Process-wide singleton. |
| — instance | `Lpnp;->N(Landroid/content/Context;)Lpnp;` | `public static`. Builds from `getApplicationContext()`. |
| — read boolean | `Lpnp;->at(I)Z` | By resource id. Body is `return Lcbv;->x(id, false)`. |
| — write any | `Lpnp;->aa(ILjava/lang/Object;)V` | Resolves the id to a key, dispatches on the boxed type, commits with `Editor.apply()`. |
| — raw prefs | `Lpnp;->I()Landroid/content/SharedPreferences;` | The live instance, so listeners can be registered on it. |
| Key cache | `Lpnj;->a(I)Ljava/lang/String;` | Resource id to preference key name. Identified by its own log strings: `PreferenceKeyCache`, `Failed to get key name from id %d:`. |

`Lpnp;` declares **three** `(I)Z` methods — `ar`, `at`, `ay`. Only a call site identifies which
carries a given preference; do not guess.

Full derivation of the glide preference id and why the write path is used:
[`glide-detection.md`](glide-detection.md).

## Gesture and decoding

| Binding | What it is |
|---|---|
| `Lgmb;` | HMM gesture decoder holder. **CJK only** — subclasses are `Lhda;` (Korean), `Lhvy;` (Pinyin Qwerty/T9), `Ljqf;`, `Ljqk;`. Not on the English glide path. |
| `Lgmb;->c()V` | Reads gesture preferences and builds the `HmmGestureDecoder` into `Lgmb;->a`. Runs on keyboard show. Never tears an existing decoder down; only `b()` does. |
| `Lgmb;->h(Lnbj;)Z` | Per-event handler. Called only from the Pinyin, Zhuyin and Korean decode processors. |
| `…/libs/gestureui/AbstractGestureMotionEventHandler` | The **Latin** glide handler. Not obfuscated. `g(Landroid/view/MotionEvent;)V` is the live path, 1453 instructions. |
| `…/motioneventhandler/scrubmove/ScrubMotionEventHandler` | Generic scrub engine. Not obfuscated. 18 methods; `g(Landroid/view/MotionEvent;)V` is the entry point and `r(Landroid/view/MotionEvent;Z)V` the movement handler. |
| — start gate | `g(…)V` offset 112, `if-ne` on `Loud;->c:I` vs `Lpbv;->a:I` | The single comparison that scopes scrub delete to backspace. `registers=13`. |
| `Lpbv;` | Config struct for the scrub engine, `<init>(IZIIIIII)V`. First argument is an Android keycode; see the field map in [`motion-event-handlers.md`](motion-event-handlers.md). |
| `Lpbu;` | Tuning constants shared by all scrub subclasses — `a:J` hold delay, `d:F`/`e:F` step thresholds, `f:J` toast delay, `g:F` rect inset. |
| `Loud;->c:I` | The keycode carried by a soft key's action. `Loud;-><init>(ILouc;Ljava/lang/Object;)V` is also how the engine dispatches, with a boxed signed step count as the payload. |
| `Lotk;->b()Loud;` | Action to its key data. Reached via `SoftKeyView;->f(Loth;)Lotk;`. |
| `Loth;->a`, `Loth;->e` | Action enum constants. The gate requires `a` present and `e` absent. |
| `Lmvr;->w(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Landroid/view/inputmethod/EditorInfo;)Z` | Reads an EditorInfo private option. The engine checks `"noScrubbing"` before doing anything. |
| `Lpax;->a:Lnea;` | Phenotype flag consulted alongside the preference in both `Lgmb;->c()` and `AbstractGestureMotionEventHandler.d()`. `Lnea;->g()` returns a boxed value. |

See [`motion-event-handlers.md`](motion-event-handlers.md) for how handlers are attached and what
the scrub engine does.

## Resources

Gboard is built with aapt2 `--collapse-resource-names`. Of **33,287** resource entries, only
**619** keep a real name; the rest read `0_resource_name_obfuscated`. Files are packed flat under
obfuscated paths (`res/aDh.xml`), and the resource table is the only way back.

| Resource | Id | Packed path |
|---|---|---|
| `enable_gesture_input` (glide preference) | `0x7f14097b` | — (string) |
| `enable_scrub_delete` (scrub preference) | `0x7f140995` | — (string) |
| Latin keyboard layout | `0x7f170779` | `res/aDh.xml` — **name collapsed** |
| `xml/settings` | `0x7f170e7e` | `res/B_o.xml` |
| `xml/settings_legacy` | `0x7f170e7f` | `res/IeH.xml` |
| `xml/setting_gesture` | `0x7f170e70` | `res/J_u.xml` |
| the `<include>` in the Latin layout | `0x7f170e54` | `res/bsB.xml` — **name collapsed** |

Only 33 `xml` names survive, and they are the settings screens plus the framework-mandated
`method`, `file_provider_paths` and `spell_checker`. That is exactly why a resource patch can
address `res/xml/settings.xml` but not the keyboard layout — Android resolves those few by name at
runtime, so they could not be collapsed.

Resolve ids with [`../tools/apk/arsc.py`](../tools/apk/README.md).

## How to re-derive these

Tools and worked examples are in [`../tools/apk/`](../tools/apk/README.md).

1. **Resolve by exact signature, never by name.** `GboardMethodTarget.resolve` matches defining
   class, name, parameter types and return type, and throws `Could not find <reference>` on a
   miss. That is deliberate: a partial match on a renamed build is worse than a hard failure.
2. **Find a method by its call site, not its name.** Obfuscated names carry no meaning and
   sibling methods share signatures. What identifies `at` among `ar`/`at`/`ay` is that
   `Lgmb;->c()V` passes the glide resource id to it.
3. **Use unobfuscated neighbours as anchors.** Framework classes, `com.google.android.libraries.*`
   names, and log strings survive minification and are the fastest way into an unfamiliar area.
4. **Assert frames, do not adapt to them.** `requireRegisterCount` turns a Gboard change into a
   loud patch-time failure instead of a register that silently means something else.

## Preference keys and the store API

Preference keys are string *resources*, not literals in code: none of `enable_scrub_delete`,
`enable_gesture_input`, `enable_secondary_symbols` or `pref_enable_flick_symbols` appears in the dex
string table. Code addresses them by **resource id**, and the settings XML by `@string` reference.
Searching the dex for a key by name therefore finds nothing, which is misleading rather than
informative.

`Lpnp;` is the store, and it mirrors most of its API across both keying styles:

| By resource id | By string | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `at(I)Z` | `k(Ljava/lang/String;Z)Z` | getBoolean |
| `F(II)I` | `b(Ljava/lang/String;I)I` | getInt |
| `z(IF)F` | `a(Ljava/lang/String;F)F` | getFloat |
| `ar(I)Z` | `as(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` | **contains** — distinguishes unset from off |
| `aa(ILjava/lang/Object;)V` | — | set, dispatching on the boxed type |
| `N(Landroid/content/Context;)Lpnp;` | | static accessor |

`ar`/`as` are what make a real default possible: write only when the key is absent, so the user can
still turn the thing off afterwards. Forcing a value on every start — what
`forceScrubPreferencesPatch` does, because the scrub gesture cannot work otherwise — has no restore
and fights anyone who changes it.

**The store lives in device-protected storage.** `Lpnp;` ends up at
`PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences` on a `createDeviceProtectedStorageContext()`, so the
file is `/data/user_de/<user>/<pkg>/shared_prefs/<packageName>_preferences.xml` and *not* the
`/data/user/…` one an ordinary context gives you. Anything writing preferences from outside the
store — an extension Activity, say — has to resolve the same context or it writes a file nobody
reads. Patched bytecode calling through `Lpnp;` is unaffected. See the derivation in
[`gboard-settings-ui.md`](gboard-settings-ui.md).

The string-keyed forms matter for patch-added settings. A resource added by a patch has no id until
aapt2 recompiles, long after the bytecode patch runs, so only a literal key can be read back.

### Finding which resource id a method uses

`dexlib.walk()` does **not** report `const` literals, so scanning it for a resource id returns zero
matches whether or not the id is used. Verified: `0x7f0c00ef` is `const v1, 0x7f0c00ef` at offset 4
of `ScrubMotionEventHandler.<init>` and the walk finds nothing. Search the raw instruction bytes
instead, the same way `res/**.xml` is searched:

```python
needle = struct.pack('<I', 0x7f140977)
raw = d.b[c['insns_off']:c['insns_off'] + c['insns_size'] * 2]
if needle in raw: ...
```

That is what located `pref_enable_flick_symbols` in `LatinApp->d`, `Lpbj;->fn` and
`LatinGestureMotionEventHandler->d`.
