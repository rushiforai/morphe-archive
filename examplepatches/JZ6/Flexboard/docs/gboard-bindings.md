# Gboard bindings

Every obfuscated name this project depends on, what it is, and how it was identified. These are
facts about **one build**, and `COMPATIBILITY_GBOARD` pins the bundle to it precisely so a
different Gboard is refused rather than mispatched.

Kept as a document as well as in `GboardBindings.kt` because the derivation is the expensive part
and does not survive in code.

## The 17.7.7 → 18.0.3 move

The bundle now targets `18.0.3.954559732-release-arm64-v8a`. **The tables below the mapping are
still written in 17.7.7's names**, because that is the build their derivations were performed
against and rewriting them wholesale would mean asserting mappings that were never checked. Only
the names in this table were re-derived; anything else here needs re-deriving before it is trusted
on 18.

R8 renames on every build, so none of this carries over by assumption. Each row was matched
structurally — identical field letters and types, identical method shapes, identical instruction
bodies — not by guessing that the alphabet shifted.

| What it is | 17.7.7 | 18.0.3 |
|---|---|---|
| Preference store | `Lpnp;` | `Lqhy;` |
| Scrub config | `Lpbv;` | `Lpvs;` |
| Scrub timings | `Lpbu;` | `Lpvr;` |
| Keyboard delegate | `Lpbr;` | `Lpvo;` |
| Event | `Lnbj;` | `Lnur;` |
| Key/action data | `Loud;` | `Lpnu;` |
| …its second ctor arg | `Louc;` | `Lpnt;` |
| Scrub state / undo text source | `Lnsz;` | `Lomu;` |
| Undo slot | `Lqcy;` | `Lqyc;` |
| Committable text | `Lnpx;` | `Lojt;` |
| Signature check | `Lqvi;` | `Lrpv;` |
| …its fallback flag | `Lquk;` | `Lrox;` |

| Member | 17.7.7 | 18.0.3 |
|---|---|---|
| Event dispatcher | `LatinIme->d(Lnbj;)Z` | `LatinIme->q(Lnur;)Z` |
| Suppression flag | `AbstractIme->N:Z` | **`AbstractIme->O:Z`** |
| Store singleton | `Lpnp;->N(Context)` | `Lqhy;->I(Context)` |
| Preference writer | `Lpnp;->aa(I,Object)V` | `Lqhy;->T(I,Object)V` |
| `contains` by id | `Lpnp;->ar(I)Z` | `Lqhy;->ak(I)Z` |
| Word-count getter | `La;->W(Lnbj;)I` | `La;->X(Lnur;)I` |

Unchanged across the move, and worth knowing because they carry most of the load:
`ScrubMotionEventHandler` and its `g`/`r`/`<init>` names, `AbstractMotionEventHandler->o:Context`,
`AbstractIme->B:Context`, `LatinIme->y`, `Lpvs;->a`/`g`/`h`, and the store's string-keyed `b`/`k`.
The two signing-certificate digests are also identical, so `COMPATIBILITY_GBOARD.signatures` needed
no edit.

## Which of these are still pinned, and which are not

**A name with a same-shaped sibling is not pinned any more.** Two bugs came from letters that moved
onto a different member of the right shape: `AbstractIme->N:Z` became `O` while `N` went on existing
as an unrelated boolean, and the undo re-commit went `s` → `t` while a smaller method inherited `s`.
Both assembled, verified and ran. Nothing static catches that, because there is nothing wrong with
the emitted code — it calls a real method with the right types. Only *what Gboard itself does with
the member* tells them apart.

So the table above is now a record of what these were, not a set of inputs. What the patches
actually do:

| member | how it is identified | why |
|---|---|---|
| suppression flag | the `move-result` / `iget-boolean` / `if-nez` run before the sole takeText call | `N` still exists on 18 as something else |
| undo re-commit | the one `AbstractIme->…(L…;Z)V` call in the dispatcher | `s` and `t` are indistinguishable by shape |
| committable text | the parameter type of that call | falls out of the same match |
| slot field, availability, clear | the register the Optional getter is called on, walked out from the re-commit | `()Z` has three candidates on the slot, `()V` has nine |
| store `getInt` | the `(String, I)I` that does **not** call `Integer.parseInt` | its sibling reads the value as text |
| store `contains` | the `(I)Z` that calls `SharedPreferences.contains` | its sibling delegates to a boolean getter |

Still pinned, and safely so — each was checked to be **signature-unique** on its class, so a rename
makes it vanish rather than letting the letter survive on the wrong member. `checkPreferenceStorePins`
and the existence helpers in `shared/Resolve.kt` assert they are still there:

`Lqhy;->I(Context)`, `Lqhy;->k(String,Z)Z`, `Lqhy;->T(I,Object)V`, `LatinIme->y`, and the slot's
`a()Lj$/util/Optional;`.

The rule to apply to anything added later: **if a member has a same-signature sibling, derive it; if
it does not, assert it exists.** Which applies is a fact about the APK, so check before choosing.

Resource ids all moved: `enable_scrub_delete` `0x7f140995`→`0x7f140a1f`, `enable_gesture_input`
`0x7f14097b`→`0x7f140a05`, `pref_enable_flick_symbols` `0x7f140977`→`0x7f140a01`. The scrub engine's
tuning dimens moved too — the vertical rect outset `Lpvr;->g:F` is `0x7f070935` on 18.0.3 (raw
`0x405`: mantissa 4, unit `MM`), was `0x7f07090d` on 17.7.7.

## Touch and dispatch

| Binding | Signature | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Pointer tracker | `Lpbl;` | Owns a finger. Where the gesture is observed. |
| — movement | `Lpbl;->B(Lcom/google/android/libraries/inputmethod/widgets/SoftKeyView;FFJI)V` | `p1` is the soft key under the finger, **`p2`/`p3` are pointer x/y**. `registers=21`. |
| — cancel | `Lpbl;->s(J)V` | Pointer cancelled. |
| — reset | `Lpbl;->C()V` | Pointer state reset. |
| — anchor | `Lpbl;->ac()V` | Call site upstream uses as an insertion anchor inside the movement method. |
| Gesture dispatcher | `Lpbj;` | Turns a pointer into a key press. |
| — dispatch | `Lpbj;->f(Lpbl;Loth;Loud;Lowd;JZZIZJI)V` | `p1` is the tracker, which is what lets a veto match a press to the gesture that consumed it. |
| — delegate field | `Lpbj;->o:Lpbh;` | |
| — delegate call | `Lpbh;->o(Lpbl;Loth;Loud;Lowd;JZZIZJI)V` | What the stock dispatch forwards to. |
| Soft key view | `Lcom/google/android/libraries/inputmethod/widgets/SoftKeyView;` | Not obfuscated. |

Note the frame of `Lpbl;->B` — 21 registers, 7 parameter words — is the one that makes
`p2` resolve to `v16`. See [`register-encoding.md`](register-encoding.md).

## Preferences

| Binding | Signature | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Store | `Lpnp;` | `public final`, extends `Lcbv;`. Process-wide singleton. |
| — instance | `Lpnp;->N(Landroid/content/Context;)Lpnp;` | `public static`. Builds from `getApplicationContext()`. |
| — read boolean | `Lpnp;->at(I)Z` | By resource id. Body is `return Lcbv;->x(id, false)`. |
| — write any | `Lpnp;->aa(ILjava/lang/Object;)V` | Resolves the id to a key, dispatches on the boxed type, commits with `Editor.apply()`. |
| — raw prefs | `Lpnp;->I()Landroid/content/SharedPreferences;` | The live instance, so listeners can be registered on it. |
| Key cache | `Lpnj;->a(I)Ljava/lang/String;` | Resource id to preference key name. Identified by its own log strings: `PreferenceKeyCache`, `Failed to get key name from id %d:`. |

`Lpnp;` declares **three** `(I)Z` methods — `ar`, `at`, `ay`. Only a call site identifies which
carries a given preference; do not guess.

## The access points bar (the toolbar), 18.0.3

The row of icons above the keyboard. Unusually friendly territory: the widget classes keep their
real names, because layouts address them as strings and R8 cannot rename what XML names.

| Binding | What it is |
|---|---|
| `…/accesspoint/widget/AccessPointsBar` | The bar itself. `extends ViewGroup` — one row, custom `onMeasure`/`onLayout`, **no scrolling and no touch callbacks of its own**. Declared in `res/HNz.xml`. |
| — capacity | `AccessPointsBar->m:I` | **Not the icon count.** Written once in `<init>(Context, AttributeSet)` at offset 72, and read in eight places that all ask the same question: *is the bar full?* — the chevron swap in `T()`, the odd-count spacer in `onMeasure`, the reserved slot in `L()`, and `y(Lmic;I)`, which evicts the last child before inserting when it believes the answer is yes. |
| — capacity getter | `AccessPointsBar->i()I` | Reached through `Lmhm;->i()I`. Feeds `Lmku;->b(I)I` as its *argument*. |
| — the render | `AccessPointsBar->m(List)V` | Sets `d = list.size()` with **no clamp against `m`**, then `W(List)` builds one child per element. The bar draws whatever list it is handed; the count is decided before this. |
| — item width | `AccessPointsBar->K(II)I` | `min((width + 2·(e + f))/(n + 1), width/n)`. Items shrink as the count grows; nothing clips. |
| — visible count | `AccessPointsBar->L()I` | Counts non-`GONE` children, plus the drag placeholder and the expand key. |
| `AccessPointsBar->a:Lnxp;` | The Phenotype flag supplier, built in `<clinit>` from `config_max_access_points` with a `ro.com.google.ime.top_icon_num` system-property override and a default of `-1`. |
| `…/accesspoint/widget/AccessPointsPanel` | The overflow panel. |
| `…/accesspoint/widget/AccessPointsPanelViewPager` | `extends BidiViewPager` — the panel already pages. **The bar does not.** |
| `Lmlh;->C(Ljava/util/List;)V` | The split. `n = min(Lmku;->b(bar.i()), size)`; `subList(0, n)` goes to the bar via `Lmhm;->m(List)`, the rest to the panel via `Lmhp;->m(List)`. |
| `Lmku;->b(I)I` | **The icon count.** Gboard's own name for it, from the log line in `Lmlf;->c()V`: `definedCountOnBar`. Takes the capacity as an argument and puts it through both gates below, so its return value — not `->m:I` — is what decides how many icons land on the bar. Five callers, and two different capacities reach it: `Lmlh;->C` passes the bar's `m`, while `Lmln;->fn` passes a theme attribute (`0x7f0400ad`, default 5) with no bar in sight. |
| `Lmlf;->c()V` | `AccessPointsListHolderController$7.onFinishUpdatingOrder`, and the anchor for the above. Logs `oldVisibleCountOnBar %d, currentVisibleCountOnBar %d, definedCountOnBar %d` and contains exactly one `(I)I` call — so a string R8 cannot rewrite names the value the obfuscated letter returns. |
| `Lmku;->b:Lqhy;` | The preference store, `Lqhy;->I(context)` cached in `<init>`. Read inside `b(I)I` itself, which is where `toolbarCountPatch` derives it — no `Context` needed at the insertion point. |
| `Lmku;->h:Lnmm;` | The device class, and what `b(I)I` picks its preference key on. Written in `<init>` from `Lnmp;->a()`, and again by `Lmkt;->a(Lnmm;)V`, the change listener — which also calls `Lmku;->d()` to rebuild. So it is **live**: opening a fold changes the class and therefore the key. |
| `Lnmm;` | `DEVICE_PHONE` `a`, `DEVICE_TABLET` `b`, `DEVICE_TV` `c`, `DEVICE_WATCH` `d`, `DEVICE_CAR` `e`, **`DEVICE_FOLDABLE` `f`**, `DEVICE_TABLET_LARGE` `g`, `DEVICE_TABLET_HUGE` `h`, `DEVICE_UNKNOWN` `i`. The names are literals in `<clinit>`, so a constant can be identified by name even though its field cannot — which is how `toolbarCountPatch` tells the foldable branch from the tablet one beside it. |
| `Lnmp;->a()Lnmm;` | `DeviceModeNotification.getCurrentDeviceMode`, unobfuscated in its own log strings. Returns `DEVICE_UNKNOWN` before the notification initialises. |
| `Lmjv;->a(II)I` | `pref >= 0 ? min(pref, cap) : b(cap)`. **The preference can only lower the count.** |
| `Lmjv;->b(I)I` | `m() ? min(3, cap) : cap` — the reduced-mode floor. |
| `Lmjr;->b(Landroid/content/Context;Z)Z` | Gboard's own "reduce your toolbar icons" flow, which writes the same preference. |

Preference ids: `0x7f1409af` = `access_points_count_on_bar`, `0x7f140a43` =
`foldable_access_points_count_on_bar`. Neither appears in any settings XML — they are written from
code only.

How the capacity is computed, and the shape the second of the patch's two insertions anchors on.
Worth reading with the row above in mind: this is the number that shipped patched in `1.1.0-dev.1`
with nothing to show for it, because the table already said `Lmjv;->a` can only lower the count and
that fact was not carried through to the conclusion.

```
44: const/4 v4, #5
45: v2 = typedArray.getInt(2, v4)               # the style attribute on res/HNz.xml
49: sget-object v5, AccessPointsBar->a:Lnxp;
51: v4 = ((Long) v5.g()).intValue()
63: if (v4 > 8 || v4 < 3) v4 = v2               # the flag is honoured only within [3, 8]
72: iput v4, v6, ->m:I
```

`toolbarCountPatch` inserts before offset 72 and leaves the `iput` alone, so the field's obfuscated
letter is never written down. **This insertion is bookkeeping, not the feature** — it keeps the
bar's own "am I full?" tests agreeing with the count set at `Lmku;->b(I)I`, and on its own it moves
nothing. It finds the site by walking from the single `Lnxp;->g()` call to the
single following `iput` whose **field type** is `I` — filtering on the opcode would also match
`->e:F` and `->f:F` at 79 and 85, since `iput` (`0x59`) covers int and float alike, and starting
after the flag call is what excludes `->y:I` at 31.

`v2` and `v5` are dead at offset 72; `v0` (the `TypedArray`), `v1`, `v3` and `v7` (the `Context`) are
not. Offset 72 is also the start of a `try` range covering 72–86 whose handler recycles the
`TypedArray` and rethrows — benign in both directions, since a throw propagates out of the
constructor either way.

## Gesture and decoding

| Binding | What it is |
|---|---|
| `Lgmb;` | HMM gesture decoder holder. **CJK only** — subclasses are `Lhda;` (Korean), `Lhvy;` (Pinyin Qwerty/T9), `Ljqf;`, `Ljqk;`. Not on the English glide path. |
| `Lgmb;->c()V` | Reads gesture preferences and builds the `HmmGestureDecoder` into `Lgmb;->a`. Runs on keyboard show. Never tears an existing decoder down; only `b()` does. |
| `Lgmb;->h(Lnbj;)Z` | Per-event handler. Called only from the Pinyin, Zhuyin and Korean decode processors. |
| `…/libs/gestureui/AbstractGestureMotionEventHandler` | The **Latin** glide handler. Not obfuscated. `g(Landroid/view/MotionEvent;)V` is the live path, 1453 instructions. |
| `…/motioneventhandler/scrubmove/ScrubMotionEventHandler` | Generic scrub engine. Not obfuscated. 18 methods; `g(Landroid/view/MotionEvent;)V` is the entry point and `r(Landroid/view/MotionEvent;Z)V` the movement handler. |
| — start gate | `g(…)V` offset 112, `if-ne` on `Loud;->c:I` vs `Lpbv;->a:I` | The single comparison that scopes scrub delete to backspace. `registers=13`. |
| `Lpbv;` | Config struct for the scrub engine, `<init>(IZIIIIII)V`. First argument is an Android keycode; see the field map in [`motion-event-handlers.md`](motion-event-handlers.md). |
| `Lpbu;` | Tuning constants shared by all scrub subclasses — `a:J` hold delay, `d:F`/`e:F` step thresholds, `f:J` toast delay, `g:F` rect inset. |
| `Loud;->c:I` | The keycode carried by a soft key's action. `Loud;-><init>(ILouc;Ljava/lang/Object;)V` is also how the engine dispatches, with a boxed signed step count as the payload. |
| `Lotk;->b()Loud;` | Action to its key data. Reached via `SoftKeyView;->f(Loth;)Lotk;`. |
| `Loth;->a`, `Loth;->e` | Action enum constants. The gate requires `a` present and `e` absent. |
| `Lmvr;->w(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Landroid/view/inputmethod/EditorInfo;)Z` | Reads an EditorInfo private option. The engine checks `"noScrubbing"` before doing anything. |
| `Lpax;->a:Lnea;` | Phenotype flag consulted alongside the preference in both `Lgmb;->c()` and `AbstractGestureMotionEventHandler.d()`. `Lnea;->g()` returns a boxed value. |

See [`motion-event-handlers.md`](motion-event-handlers.md) for how handlers are attached and what
the scrub engine does.

## Resources

Gboard is built with aapt2 `--collapse-resource-names`. Of **33,287** resource entries, only
**619** keep a real name; the rest read `0_resource_name_obfuscated`. Files are packed flat under
obfuscated paths (`res/aDh.xml`), and the resource table is the only way back.

| Resource | Id | Packed path |
|---|---|---|
| `enable_gesture_input` (glide preference) | `0x7f14097b` | — (string) |
| `enable_scrub_delete` (scrub preference) | `0x7f140995` | — (string) |
| Latin keyboard layout | `0x7f170779` | `res/aDh.xml` — **name collapsed** |
| `xml/settings` | `0x7f170e7e` | `res/B_o.xml` |
| `xml/settings_legacy` | `0x7f170e7f` | `res/IeH.xml` |
| `xml/setting_gesture` | `0x7f170e70` | `res/J_u.xml` |
| the `<include>` in the Latin layout | `0x7f170e54` | `res/bsB.xml` — **name collapsed** |

Only 33 `xml` names survive, and they are the settings screens plus the framework-mandated
`method`, `file_provider_paths` and `spell_checker`. That is exactly why a resource patch can
address `res/xml/settings.xml` but not the keyboard layout — Android resolves those few by name at
runtime, so they could not be collapsed.

Resolve ids with [`../tools/apk/arsc.py`](../tools/apk/README.md).

## How to re-derive these

Tools and worked examples are in [`../tools/apk/`](../tools/apk/README.md).

1. **Resolve by exact signature, never by name.** `GboardMethodTarget.resolve` matches defining
   class, name, parameter types and return type, and throws `Could not find <reference>` on a
   miss. That is deliberate: a partial match on a renamed build is worse than a hard failure.
2. **Find a method by its call site, not its name.** Obfuscated names carry no meaning and
   sibling methods share signatures. What identifies `at` among `ar`/`at`/`ay` is that
   `Lgmb;->c()V` passes the glide resource id to it.
3. **Use unobfuscated neighbours as anchors.** Framework classes, `com.google.android.libraries.*`
   names, and log strings survive minification and are the fastest way into an unfamiliar area.
4. **Assert frames, do not adapt to them.** `requireRegisterCount` turns a Gboard change into a
   loud patch-time failure instead of a register that silently means something else.

## Preference keys and the store API

Preference keys are string *resources*, not literals in code: none of `enable_scrub_delete`,
`enable_gesture_input`, `enable_secondary_symbols` or `pref_enable_flick_symbols` appears in the dex
string table. Code addresses them by **resource id**, and the settings XML by `@string` reference.
Searching the dex for a key by name therefore finds nothing, which is misleading rather than
informative.

`Lpnp;` is the store, and it mirrors most of its API across both keying styles:

| By resource id | By string | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `at(I)Z` | `k(Ljava/lang/String;Z)Z` | getBoolean |
| `F(II)I` | `b(Ljava/lang/String;I)I` | getInt |
| `z(IF)F` | `a(Ljava/lang/String;F)F` | getFloat |
| `ar(I)Z` | `as(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` | **contains** — distinguishes unset from off |
| `aa(ILjava/lang/Object;)V` | — | set, dispatching on the boxed type |
| `N(Landroid/content/Context;)Lpnp;` | | static accessor |

`ar`/`as` are what make a real default possible: write only when the key is absent, so the user can
still turn the thing off afterwards. Forcing a value on every start — what
`forceScrubPreferencesPatch` does, because the scrub gesture cannot work otherwise — has no restore
and fights anyone who changes it.

**The store lives in device-protected storage.** `Lpnp;` ends up at
`PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences` on a `createDeviceProtectedStorageContext()`, so the
file is `/data/user_de/<user>/<pkg>/shared_prefs/<packageName>_preferences.xml` and *not* the
`/data/user/…` one an ordinary context gives you. Anything writing preferences from outside the
store — an extension Activity, say — has to resolve the same context or it writes a file nobody
reads. Patched bytecode calling through `Lpnp;` is unaffected. See the derivation in
[`gboard-settings-ui.md`](gboard-settings-ui.md).

The string-keyed forms matter for patch-added settings. A resource added by a patch has no id until
aapt2 recompiles, long after the bytecode patch runs, so only a literal key can be read back.

### Finding which resource id a method uses

`dexlib.walk()` does **not** report `const` literals, so scanning it for a resource id returns zero
matches whether or not the id is used. Verified: `0x7f0c00ef` is `const v1, 0x7f0c00ef` at offset 4
of `ScrubMotionEventHandler.<init>` and the walk finds nothing. Search the raw instruction bytes
instead, the same way `res/**.xml` is searched:

```python
needle = struct.pack('<I', 0x7f140977)
raw = d.b[c['insns_off']:c['insns_off'] + c['insns_size'] * 2]
if needle in raw: ...
```

That is what located `pref_enable_flick_symbols` in `LatinApp->d`, `Lpbj;->fn` and
`LatinGestureMotionEventHandler->d`.
