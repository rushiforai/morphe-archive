Flexboard's settings screen is a plain Gboard settings screen: same host, same rows, same store.
This is how the pieces fit, from a row tap to a persisted slider value.

## Navigating: there is no router

The root settings screen (`res/xml/settings.xml`, binary `res/B_o.xml`) is a
`PreferenceScreen` whose rows are `HeaderPreference`s carrying an `android:fragment` attribute:

```
fragment = com.google.android.apps.inputmethod.latin.preference.PreferencesSettingsFragment
```

(In the binary the attribute lands in the `res/android` namespace; that is what aapt produced for
Gboard and what this project's own edits match.)

A tap runs the androidx click path — Gboard ships a renamed port of it:

1. `Preference.performClick()` → `onClick()`, then the row listener, then the tree listener:
   `Lcdr;->aA(Landroidx/preference/Preference;)Z` (the `PreferenceFragmentCompat`.
   `onPreferenceTreeClick` port; tree/click plumbing is `Lcdw;`/`Lcdi;`).
2. If `Preference`'s fragment field is set, the host (`Lqip;`, parent of
   `com.google.android.apps.inputmethod.latin.preference.SettingsActivity`) records the row key
   and calls the androidx `Fragment.instantiate` port, `Lad;->C(Context, String, Bundle)` — a
   `Class.forName` lookup plus a public no-arg constructor — then a fragment transaction (`Lbf;`)
   with back-stack. If the attribute is absent it falls through to the `<intent>` child, which is
   what the old Activity-based screen used.

No registry, map or allow-set sits in front of in-app navigation. The only fragment registry in
the app is a Dagger `Map<String, Provider<Fragment>>` (`Lch;->a()`, 23 entries keyed on
`settings_header_*` strings) used by **external deep links** (the system "IME settings" button
etc., extras `ENTER_PREF_HEADER`, `:settings:fragment_args_key` — a `>`-joined key path,
`:android:show_fragment_args`). Unknown keys return null and fall back to the root screen;
nothing crashes. None of it is needed for a row-launched screen.

## The fragment contract

`Class.forName` + transaction impose the whole contract:

- public class, public no-arg constructor;
- extends Gboard's fragment chain — `CommonPreferenceFragment` → `Ldoe;` → `Lcdr;` (the
  `PreferenceFragmentCompat` port) → `Lad;` (the `Fragment` port). Verified concrete end to end,
  so a subclass providing nothing but an `aB()` override links and verifies;
- the screen is chosen by overriding `aB()I` → a `res/xml` resource id. Base returns 0 = blank
  screen. The concrete subclasses verified against: `GesturePreferenceSettingsFragment.aB()` →
  `xml/setting_gesture`, `PreferencesSettingsFragment.aB()` → `xml/setting_preferences`, and
  `SettingsActivity` itself embeds `xml/settings` / `xml/settings_legacy`.

Because patch-added resources have no id until aapt2 relinks, `aB()` resolves by **name**:
`getResources().getIdentifier("flexboard_settings", "xml", pkg)` — the same trick the settings
icon already used. The Context needed for it is the one piece of framework the subclass cannot
inherit by name (`getContext()` is an obfuscated member of `Lad;`), so the extension fragment
asks the published IME service first and falls back to the framework's
`ActivityThread.currentApplication()` by reflection; failing both it returns 0 — a blank screen,
deliberately not a crash, because the host going down with a row tap is worse.

The stub trick: the extension's fragment subclasses a compile-only stand-in
(`stubs/…/CommonPreferenceFragment.java`) declaring exactly the public no-arg constructor and
`public int aB()`. It lives outside `extensions/` because the Morphe settings plugin treats
every directory under there as an extension module. It is consumed `compileOnly`, so it is never
dexed; the superclass reference resolves against the real class once the extension DEX is merged
into the APK.

## Storage: the store installs itself

`Lqof;` registers a `FragmentLifecycleCallbacks` on every activity. On fragment creation it
checks `instanceof Lcdr` and installs a `PreferenceDataStore` (bridging into `Lqhy;`, Gboard's
own preference backend, device-protected storage) onto the fragment's manager. Anything our
fragment's rows persist therefore lands in the same store the swipe patches read mid-gesture —
the fix for the dev.3–dev.6 saga comes free, because there is nothing left to mirror. The old
pitfalls (credential-encrypted vs device-protected contexts) are documented in
`gboard-settings-ui.md` and only apply to code writing the store **without** this hook, which is
why `Preferences`/`Defaults` in the extension still mirror the context dance.

## The slider: `InlineSliderPreference`

`com.google.android.libraries.inputmethod.preferencewidgets.InlineSliderPreference` (the widget
on the Morse-keyboard screen) reads its configuration by **literal attribute name** off a null
namespace, so no attribute resources need to exist:

| attribute | default | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `slider_min_value` | 0 | `Lrqi;->d`: `getAttributeResourceValue` — reference → int resource; otherwise literal int |
| `slider_max_value` | 100 | same reader |
| `slider_scale` | 1.0 | stored float `N`; persistence writes `Integer.toString(round(v*N))` when `N` is whole |
| `slider_display_scale` | 0.0 | display only |
| `slider_unit` | — | raw string suffix on the value bubble (`ms`) |
| `slider_text_left` / `slider_text_right` | — | end labels (`1` / `No limit`) |

Persistence and restore are `Preference.ae(String)` / `Preference.w(String)` through the
datastore. With the default scale of 1 the stored form is a base-10 integer in a string; the
readers on the patch side therefore use the store's **parsing** string-keyed getInt, resolved in
`Fingerprints.kt` by its call to `Integer.parseInt` — the typed sibling would throw
`ClassCastException` on the string, and this one would throw on a leftover int, which is why the
two keys are new (`flexboard_swipe_*`) instead of migrated.

`android:defaultValue` is the ordinary androidx mechanism (written under the `res/android`
namespace, as Gboard's own binaries carry it) and persists once, on first bind.

## Intercepting row clicks

The screen's rows are all stock widgets, but a row whose tap must run Flexboard code — the
per-slot composite hotkey editor, the Export/Import buttons — is intercepted in the hosted
fragment's `aA(Landroidx/preference/Preference;)Z`, the port of `PreferenceFragmentCompat.
onPreferenceTreeClick`:

```
Preference.I()V                    the ported performClick
  -> o:Lcdi                        per-row listener, if the XML set one
  -> k:Lcdw  (the manager)  -> .d:Lcdr   the hosted fragment
       -> Lcdr;->aA(Preference)Z   virtual — our override runs first
  -> s:Landroid/content/Intent;    fallback when aA returns false
```

`super.aA(preference)` keeps the untouched rows working (the swipe slider, the About row), since
it is the base implementation, not a null default. Do **not** hand a hotkey row back to it: the
hotkeys are plain Preferences on purpose (a dialog-backed row shows the stock editor ahead of
`aA` — the two-dialogs bug), so "fall back to super" is a dead row. The hotkey tap's real
fallback is the summary note written by the fragment.

The obfuscated surface this rides on, all pinned by body shape **and access flags** in
preflight's settings section:

| letter | is the ported | identified by |
|---|---|---|
| `Lcdr;->aA(Preference)Z` | `onPreferenceTreeClick` | on the host's superclass chain; called once from `I()V` |
| `Lcdr;->d(CharSequence)Preference` | `PreferenceFragmentCompat.findPreference` | reads manager field `b`, delegates to `Lcdw;->d` |
| `Preference;->n(CharSequence)V` | `setSummary` | throws `"Preference already has a SummaryProvider set."` |
| `Preference;->N(Drawable)V` | `setIcon` | writes field `c:…Drawable;`, clears `b:I`, notifies |
| `Preference;->j:Landroid/content/Context;` | the row's construction context | read by `I()V` for its `startActivity` fallback |

**There is no `getKey`.** R8 inlines one-instruction getters out of the dex entirely — `66`
methods survive on `Preference` and none of them returns the key. Do not compile dispatch code
against androidx source names: it links clean and then dies on device. And check **access**, not
just existence: `Preference;->t(String)` *is* the real findPreference, sitting right there in
the dex — but `protected`, so calling it from the fragment throws `IllegalAccessError` on the
first tap (caught in review, before release; the extension's stub omits it so a stray call fails
to compile instead). Row identity therefore rides the fragment's own chain:
`d("flexboard_hotkey_3_text") == tapped`.

Rows also cannot refresh at bind time — no bind-hook letter is known to the stub — so the
settings fragment re-paints the rows from the store (icon, and the summary showing the committed
text) from a **main-looper post inside `aB()`**: inflation finishes synchronously right after
`aB()` returns the screen id, and a posted runnable necessarily lands after that — after the
rows exist, before any tap. If the pass finds no rows or no context (cold open before the
keyboard's first run) it no-ops and the first tap repaints instead (`syncRowIconsOnce`).
The hotkey rows are deliberately **plain** Preferences: a DialogPreference's onClick shows the
stock dialog ahead of `aA` (the two-dialogs bug), so no dialog-backed row may sit on this
screen. Plain rows also own `n()` — the provider-guarded throw only exists on
EditTextPreference rows, of which there are none.

## Dialogs: popups off the row's own context

The composite hotkey editor and the export/import popups are hand-built dialogs — but they hang
off **Gboard's** theme, not an invented one. Every row object carries the context it was
constructed with (the settings host Activity) in the `j` field: written in the 4-arg
constructor, and consumed by the ported `performClick` via `Context.startActivity` **without**
`FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` — the proof it is an Activity, not a wrapper. (The field's visibility
doesn't matter to the read; its *name* does, which is what the preflight pin asserts.)

- Reach is `Preference.class.getDeclaredField("j")` + `setAccessible(true)`. Reflection on an
  app class is unrestricted — hidden-API enforcement covers the boot classpath, not this dex.
- The pin is structural: preflight's `performClick` check asserts `j` among the field reads, so
  a rename fails at pre-push instead of silently downgrading the UI.
- The dialog class is the **framework** `AlertDialog` — deliberately. The dex ships zero
  appcompat/M3 dialog classes (checked 18.0.3); Gboard's own dialogs are built from the same
  primitives. The theme (`alertDialogTheme`, colours, corner shapes) inherits from the host
  Activity, so the chrome reads native; only the content is ours.
- Every dialog path is wrapped in a typed catch. Any failure — no field, no activity, a
  `BadTokenException` — falls back to the no-dialog behavior (a hotkey row reports it in its
  summary instead of showing an editor; import reads the clipboard; export is
  clipboard + summary). The popups are layered on top of the screen, never instead of it.

## Failure checklist

- Tap works but no popup appears (a hotkey row instead updates its summary with the unavailable
  note; import reads the clipboard silently) → the dialog path fell back: the `j` field moved (preflight's
  performClick pin should have failed first) or the row context was not an Activity on that
  path. The fallback is deliberate; the regression to hunt is the missed popup, not a crash.
- Row tap does nothing at all (no dialog, no outcome text) → the click chain moved: preflight's
  `settings: performClick dispatches to aA…` checks name the seam. An `aA` that exists but is
  never called is invisible until tapped, which is why the caller is pinned, not just the letter.
- Row tap crashes `NoSuchMethodError` → a row-letter (`d`/`n`/`N`) was renamed by a Gboard bump;
  `IllegalAccessError` instead → one of them changed visibility. Preflight's settings section
  pins each by shape **and** access flags. Never dispatch on `getKey()` or on `Preference`'s own
  findPreference — the first is absent, the second is protected (see "Intercepting row clicks").
- A hotkey edit doesn't reach the toolbar → the write went to a key the toolbar emission does
  not read. `Hotkeys.textKey`/`iconKey` are the single source; the row's XML key must equal
  `textKey`, and the composite dialog commits from its dismiss hook (Save/back/outside-tap
  write; Cancel sets the discard flag the hook checks first), then the row's summary is
  repainted from the store.
- Row tap crashes with `Fragment$InstantiationException` → the class name on the row does not
  match the extension class, or the constructor/visibility contract broke.
- Screen opens blank → `aB()` returned 0 (no Context, or the resource name in the XML and the
  fragment's constant disagree) — never an exception.
- Slider moves but the engine does not change → key mismatch between the XML and
  `ScrubTuningPatch.kt` (the constants checker exists for exactly this), or the reader resolved
  the typed getInt instead of the parsing one.
- Rows render unstyled → the row XML lost the `HeaderPreference` class name; do not substitute
  the androidx default.
