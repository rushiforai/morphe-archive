**🎯 Supported versions:**

| :---: |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Hill Climb Racing Ad Removal](#hill-climb-racing-ad-removal) | Completely removes ads: banners and interstitials can never be displayed (CFirebaseAds.showBanners/showInterstitial become no-ops) and ad-free is granted once per app start — loadStore() seeds mAdFree = 1, the native engine's poll grants it and the store's own reset (inappPurchasesProcessed) zeroes the field, so no repeated purchase popups. |  |
| [Hill Climb Racing Free Store](#hill-climb-racing-free-store) | Every store item is granted instantly and free: coins, gems, paints, ad-skips, ad-free and bundles, without launching Google Play billing. |  |
| [Hill Climb Racing Instant Rewarded Video Rewards](#hill-climb-racing-instant-rewarded-video-rewards) | Rewarded video ads grant their reward instantly without playing the ad: the native engine receives onVideoStartedSuccess + onVideoCompletedSuccess on the GL thread, exactly as if the video had been watched and completed. |  |
