/**
 * Hill Climb Racing — Instant Rewarded Video Rewards
 *
 * playRewardedVideoAd(String, int) is the JNI entry the native C++ engine
 * (libgame.so) calls to grant a rewarded-video reward. Normally it plays the
 * ad via CFirebaseAds.showVideoAd(String) and waits for the ad SDK's
 * onVideoStarted/onVideoClosed callbacks. We skip the ad entirely and instead
 * fire the SAME native callbacks the engine uses for a completed video:
 *
 *   MainActivity$$ExternalSyntheticLambda12 (Runnable) → lambda$onVideoStarted$19
 *     → MainActivity.onVideoStartedSuccess()   (native — tells engine "ad started")
 *   MainActivity$$ExternalSyntheticLambda16 (Runnable) → lambda$onVideoClosed$20
 *     → MainActivity.onVideoCompletedSuccess() (native — tells engine "video done, grant reward")
 *
 * Both lambdas are queued via MainActivity.queueOnGLThread(Runnable), the
 * exact same pattern the game's own onVideoStarted(Bundle)/onVideoClosed(Bundle)
 * handlers use (MainActivity.smali:5136 / 5068). The native reward-granting
 * functions require the GL thread, so we never call them directly.
 *
 * Register safety: playRewardedVideoAd has .registers 2 (v0=p0 String adUnit,
 * v1=p1 int). We insert at index 0 and immediately clobber v0 with
 * new-instance — the original adUnit param is dead after our early return.
 * The original body (including the exception handler) stays in place but is
 * unreachable. This mirrors the game's own exception path, which also
 * clobbers p0 with new-instance (MainActivity.smali:2656).
 *
 * Confirmed smali: MainActivity.smali:2640, 2354 (lambda$onVideoStarted$19),
 * 2340 (lambda$onVideoClosed$20), ExternalSyntheticLambda12/16 run() methods.
