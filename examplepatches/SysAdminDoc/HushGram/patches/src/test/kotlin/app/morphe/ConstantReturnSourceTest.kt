/**
 * No patch replaces a whole method with smali it wrote out by hand.
 *
 * <p>`returnEarly` checks the method's return type before it emits anything, and since the four
 * sites this gate was written for it checks that the frame holds the registers the value is
 * written into. Raw smali at index 0 checks neither: `MandatoryLoginService.shouldShowForcedLogin`
 * was taking `const/4 v0` and `return v0` on the strength of a fingerprint that matched on class
 * suffix and method name alone, so a build that boxed that answer would have shipped an integer
 * return on a method declaring an object and failed dex verification on the phone, which is a
 * long way from the patch that caused it.
 *
 * <p>Only the whole-method shape is refused: an insertion at index 0 whose entire body is a
 * constant and the return of that same register, or a bare `return-void`. A constant and a return
 * inside a guard, after an `if-eqz`, is ordinary patch code and is left alone.
 *
 * <p>This is a net, not a proof. It reads the shapes spelled out in the regexes below, and a
 * spelling nobody has written yet can walk past it: smali held in a local and handed in, or a
 * mnemonic the alternation does not list. It caught every site in the tree when it was written
 * and it is worth widening when it misses one, rather than being read as a guarantee that none
 * exists.
