 * Unset, every fixture test skips and says which variable to set: the APKs are hundreds of
 * megabytes each and are not in the repository. Set, the folder has to hold what the test reads.
 * A variable pointing at a missing or empty folder is a broken setup, and skipping there would
 * read as a pass. There is no default folder: one used to be a path on the maintainer's machine,
 * which skipped quietly everywhere else and published that machine's layout.
