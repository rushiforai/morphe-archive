 * path and not only on the one a forward walk happens to take. [findFreeRegister] scans
 * forward from an index and treats a switch as a leaf, which is enough for most hooks and
 * gave up on a 509-instruction profile view-model where a report call had to be guarded; this
 * is the same question answered properly.
 *
 * <p>Reads are over-approximated on purpose. A register named by an instruction counts as
 * read unless it is the plain destination of an instruction that only writes it, and any
 * register named by a wide, long or double instruction counts along with the one above it.
 * Over-counting reads can only make a register look live, never free, so a register this
 * says is dead is dead.
 *
 * <p>The question asked of it is which registers a hook put in front of an instruction must
 * leave alone, so inside a try a handler's reads count before the instruction's own write, even
 * where the instruction can't throw: the hook's code can.
