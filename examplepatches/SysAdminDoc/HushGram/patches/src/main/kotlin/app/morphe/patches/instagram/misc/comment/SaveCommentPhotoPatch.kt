/**
 * Save in the common comment menu, for a photo the comment itself carries.
 *
 * The selected comment keeps the raw comment it was converted from, and that keeps its own
 * media_comment_info, parsed from the server's JSON or read from its tree, with the photo's Media
 * inside. The extension asks a bridge for that Media and lists the sizes Instagram supplied, so the
 * save picks the largest without building an address. The parent post's media_info is never read.
 * The row shares the renderer's one call with Copy comment and has its own row type, so either
 * patch works alone or with the other.
