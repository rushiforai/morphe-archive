 * extension, which lets the next reel's first start through as if it were tapped.
 *
 * The call goes in right in front of the pager's move, not at the method's entry. On 449 the move
 * (07SD.A03) reads its pager from the field its superclass keeps (0Amt.A02) first thing, and when
 * there's none it still goes on to log and reaches the end without moving anything, so a call at
 * the entry would let a start through that no move brought. The pager's call is reached only by
 * falling through its own null check, so in front of it the hook runs when the pager moves and
 * never otherwise. It goes before the call rather than after because the instruction after the call
 * is where the null check lands, and because the extension must know before anything the move sets
 * off asks the gate, however soon that is. The call names no register, so it borrows none, and its
 * method returns nothing and never throws, so Instagram's move goes on exactly as it would.

/**
 * The auto scroller's move to the next reel, or null when this build has no method carrying
 * [SCROLL_TO_NEXT_REEL], with a warning in the patch log.
 *
 * The move must be the one method carrying the marker, a static (scroller, boolean) that returns
 * nothing. Its pager is the one object field the scroller inherits from its superclass that the
 * move reads off the scroller, and the move is the one call taking nothing and returning nothing on
 * that field's type. That call's receiver must come straight from a read of that field off the
 * scroller, with nothing jumping in between or to the call itself, since the hook goes in front of
 * the call and a jump there would skip it.
 *
 * A marker that's there but leads anywhere else stops the whole patch: the scroller is still in the
 * build and has changed in a way this hook doesn't understand, so guessing at it could let starts
 * through that no move brought. A marker that's gone doesn't. Instagram's build drops these markers
 * over time ("android_purge_" is what they're for), and auto scroll is a Reels setting most people
 * leave off. Without the hook, Tap to play still does everything it did before this one was added,
 * and with auto scroll on each reel after the first waits for a tap, as it always had. Refusing would
 * take the patch from everyone over that.
