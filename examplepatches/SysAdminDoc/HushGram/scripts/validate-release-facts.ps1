<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Check public release facts against the generated patch list.

.DESCRIPTION
    The generated patches-list.json is the local source for the release version, target
    package, target version and patch count. This check makes README.md, patches-bundle.json
    and the recorded runtime and patch test counts agree before a release is published. It also checks
    the canonical Morphe add-source link in the README and verifies that its landing page is live. A guarded
    preparation mode lets the source commit reach GitHub while the public index still points
    at the previous working bundle. Published-asset verification remains strict, and it also
    fetches the release SBOM the receipt names, holds it to the bundle and puts the libraries it
    lists to OSV (release-advisories.ps1), and fetches the published receipt, which SHA256SUMS.txt
    has to list and which has to be the receipt checked here. It also refuses a release whose
    Instagram source census (sources/instagram-sources.json, refreshed by
    audit-instagram-sources.ps1) is more than 14 days old or breaks the ledger's rules.

    Before HushGram's first release there is no patches-bundle.json. Until one is committed, the
    checks that read the index, its download address, its description, the add-source link and
    the GitHub description are left out with a line saying so, and everything else still runs:
    the version in gradle.properties, the README's version badge, target build and Manager floor,
    the bug form's placeholders, the CHANGELOG, the bundle's patcher stamp and the receipt when
    there is one. -VerifyPublishedAsset needs the index, since the release it checks is the one
    the index publishes.

    Taken from Hushfacebook's scripts/validate-release-facts.ps1
    (https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/Hushfacebook, commit 814acd23d7b70d5d23abce6cb6c97767e16a051e),
    which came from Hushfeed (https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/hushfeed). GPL-3.0-only.
    Modified for HushGram (Instagram), 2026: Instagram's package, build and bug form, HushGram's
    source ledger and variables, the pre-release mode above, and a version still being prepared
    may be described under the CHANGELOG's Unreleased heading.

    .SYNOPSIS
        The CHANGELOG still describes what it described at the last tag, and describes this
        version in a form Morphe Manager can show.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Held against the file as it stood at the most recent tag reachable from HEAD, which is
        read with git. A checkout with no tag, or one where that tag carried no CHANGELOG, is
        still held to naming the version it builds; there is simply nothing older to compare.

        HushGram describes a version it's still building under "## Unreleased", in a
        "### HushGram v<version>" section, and gives it its dated heading when it's released. So a
        version the index doesn't publish yet may be described either way, and one with a dated
        heading is held to what Manager reads. The version the index publishes needs its heading.
