.SYNOPSIS
    The release provenance receipt: how it is built, and what makes one valid.

.DESCRIPTION
    Taken from Hushfacebook's scripts/release-receipt.ps1
    (https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/Hushfacebook, commit 814acd23d7b70d5d23abce6cb6c97767e16a051e),
    which came from Hushfeed (https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/hushfeed). GPL-3.0-only.
    Modified for HushGram (Instagram), 2026: the aapt2 lookup, the manifest reader and the
    manifest delta with its allowlist live in apk-facts.ps1 here, which this file dot-sources, the
    SBOM's first-party mark is HushGram's, and Morphe Manager's changelog scope is Instagram.
    Invoke-RepoGit's read of git's output follows Hushfacebook commit
    3716793a4c7f0cda3595b021cff12316aafea41f (Use-Utf8ConsoleOutput, in common.ps1).

    Dot-sourced by build-release-receipt.ps1 and validate-release-facts.ps1. A checksum on its
    own says a file has not changed since somebody hashed it. It cannot say which APK the patches
    were proved against, which commit built the bundle, which toolchain stamped it, or what the
    patches did to the Android manifest, and those are the facts that decide whether a local
    patch run is the one the release describes.

    Everything here is read back out of files rather than taken on trust: the APK hashes off the
    fixtures, the bundle hash and size off the .mpp, the patch verdicts out of the desktop CLI's
    own result report, and the manifest delta out of aapt2's reading of both APKs.

    The manifest delta is the part that needs a human. A patch that adds a permission or exports
    a component changes what the patched app can do and what other apps can reach, so every entry
    has to be written down in scripts/manifest-delta-allowlist.txt and stays until somebody takes
    it out. An entry nothing produces any more fails the run too: an allowlist that outlives its
    reason stops being a review.

    The SBOM :patches:releaseSbom writes beside the bundle says what the bundle carries: every
    library and the version it resolved to. The receipt records its hash, and the SBOM records the
    bundle's, so neither can be swapped for another build's without the pair coming apart.

function Get-ReleaseReceiptSchemaVersion {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Bumped when the shape changes in a way a reader has to know about.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Validation refuses a receipt written to a different version rather than guessing which
        fields moved. A function rather than a variable because this file is dot-sourced into
        several scripts, and a script-scoped variable in a dot-sourced file belongs to whichever
        one sourced it. Resolve-ReceiptSchema reads the number out of this function's body at an
        older commit, so it stays a bare return.

        2 added sbom: the file name, SHA-256 and component count of the release SBOM.
        3 added input-derived per-target coverage and exact-fixture coverage review.
        4 adds the canonical production identity and verifies its exact extension payload bytes.

function Resolve-ReceiptSchema {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        The schema a receipt should be held to: the one its own commit's builder wrote.
    .DESCRIPTION
        A receipt describes a release that has shipped, and one cut before schema 2 has no SBOM
        to name. Holding it to schema 2 would refuse every later push from the checkout that cut
        it, which is the trap Resolve-ReceiptToolchain describes for the patcher pin. So the
        number is read out of scripts/release-receipt.ps1 at the receipt's commit. On a release
        push the receipt's commit is the commit being released, whose builder writes this
        checkout's schema, so nothing is relaxed for a new release.

        A commit with no receipt script this can read is held to this checkout's schema, and one
        whose script writes a newer schema than this checkout reads throws. Answers
        @{ Version; Note }, where Note is a line worth printing or $null.

        A library whose package URL isn't a Maven one naming its own group, name and version

        commit is the release commit, so the list is the one the tree carries and nothing is
        relaxed. A commit with no allowlist, and a receipt naming no commit, are held to the one at

        and an app only gets its update badge when a bullet is scoped to it, "* **Instagram:** ...".
        Scoped lines are kept one line at a time, so a bullet wrapped onto a second line loses
        the rest. In Hushfacebook every heading from 0.23.0 to 0.40.0 was bare, Manager's list stopped at 0.22.0
        and every update showed nothing, and no gate noticed, because Test-ChangelogVersions
        reads its own heading pattern, which the bare headings matched.

        Only the section being released is held to this. Older sections are frozen as shipped.

    .DESCRIPTION
        `git -C <path>` sets the working directory and does not override GIT_DIR. Every script

        GIT_WORK_TREE already in its environment, so without this a -Root parameter is a

        In Hushfacebook on 2026-09-15 that turned a temporary fixture into three commits on the
        real branch.

        git writes what it shows as UTF-8, and PowerShell reads a native command's output in the
        console's code page, which is 437 in a hook started from Git Bash. A file read out of a
        commit came back with its byte order mark as three characters, and any other character
        past ASCII changed the same way, so Use-Utf8ConsoleOutput (common.ps1) has PowerShell read
        UTF-8 for the call, even in a process with no console.

    .DESCRIPTION
        A receipt describes a release that has already shipped. Moving the patcher pin afterwards
        does not make it wrong, but holding it to the working catalog said it was: in Hushfacebook,
        after the pin moved to 1.13.0 while the tree still carried the receipt for 0.32.0, every
        source push failed with "The receipt was stamped by patcher 1.12.0; the catalog pins
        1.13.0", with both files correct. Only the checkout that cut the release has a receipt at
        all, so the gate stopped exactly the machine that had done the work, and the way through
        was to move the receipt out of the tree, which turns the check off altogether.

        catalog the working tree has and nothing is relaxed.

    .SYNOPSIS
        The Manager floor the index description has to name: the one the published release's own
        commit pinned, found through its tag.
    .DESCRIPTION
        The index describes a release that has shipped, and that release needs the Manager its own
        commit pinned, whatever the catalog pins since. Hushfacebook 0.1.1 was stamped by patcher
        1.14.0 and needs Manager 1.31.0 after the catalog moved on to 1.14.1 and 1.32.0 for the next release,
        so neither the working catalog nor the index version alone gives the answer. The tag
        v<version> says which commit it was.

        -Commit is that commit when the caller has read the published tag already, as the release
        check's published asset run does. Without it, -RemoteUrl is asked first: a local tag can
        name another commit than GitHub's after a release is re-cut there, and git fetch won't move
        it, and `gh release create` makes the tag on GitHub only, so the push that writes a new
        description comes from a clone without one. The clone's own tag answers when no remote is
        named, or when the remote doesn't have the tag or can't be asked. A tag found nowhere, a
        commit this clone doesn't hold, or one with no catalog can't tell, and answers Floor $null
        with a Note saying the check didn't run.

    .SYNOPSIS
        The patch list a receipt should be held to: the one its own commit carried.
    .DESCRIPTION
        The same reasoning as Resolve-ReceiptToolchain, for the patch names and the target. A patch
        added or renamed after a release doesn't make that release's receipt wrong, but holding
        the receipt to the working patch list said it was. While the source version stays on the
        released one, as it did through Hushfeed's hold after 0.58.0, every such push failed on the one
        machine that has a receipt. On Hushfeed that read: "The receipt reports com.zhiliaoapp.musically
        46.2.3 patch Hide quick comment reactions, which the catalog does not list."

        On a release push the receipt's commit is the release commit, so this reads the list the
        working tree has and nothing is relaxed.
