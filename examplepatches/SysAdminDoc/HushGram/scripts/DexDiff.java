/**
 * Names every method a patched APK does not share with the clean one it was built from, and prints
 * the register evidence for each: how many registers the method declares, and every instruction the
 * two bodies do not have in common.
 *
 * <p>The point of it is the last line of the report. A patch that writes into a register the method
 * never declared assembles happily and only fails when a device verifies the class, so every
 * instruction that was not in the clean body is checked against the register count of the method it
 * landed in. Methods the patch adds outright, which is where a hand-written bridge lives and where
 * the registers are chosen rather than inherited, are checked the same way: every one of them, the
 * helpers a patch adds to one of Instagram's own classes as well as the extension's. Every
 * instruction of every changed and added method is also held to its method's count in the structural
 * pass, the upper half of each wide value it reads or writes included, and one out of range is a
 * finding there rather than a register the later checks step over.
 *
 * <p>Three things this deliberately does not leave to chance:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A wide instruction names one register and occupies two, so a destination that sets a wide
 *       register counts as reaching one higher than it names. Missing that would let a
 *       {@code const-wide} one short of the ceiling read as safe.
 *   <li>The highest register travels with the rendered line rather than being read back out of the
 *       text, because this app has string constants that look like register names ({@code v4190},
 *       {@code v20200906}) and parsing the text flags five of them.
 *   <li>Absence of evidence is a failure, not a pass. A run that finds no changed methods, or no
 *       added methods of the extension's own, is comparing the wrong pair of files and says so
 *       instead of reporting nothing wrong.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Branch targets and try-block ranges are part of a body's identity here, so a change that only
 * moves a jump or widens an exception range still shows up as a changed method.
 *
 * <p>Every changed and added method is also held to the structural rules that came out of crash
 * reports on patched Facebook builds (FroggoMorphePatches issues 3, 16 and 21), where this check
 * started (Hushfacebook): a branch or switch case that lands inside an instruction ("target dex pc
 * is not at instruction start"), an invoke whose registers don't match what the callee takes, a
 * parameter register read as the wrong kind (the static and wide off-by-one), a register the body
 * wrote at the wrong width (a narrow const left where a const-wide was, which an AMOLED sweep did
 * on Facebook 580), a move-result cut off from its invoke, and a try range or handler off an
 * instruction boundary. A contract file adds rules about the whole APK
 * (scripts/injected-mutation-contracts.txt): each guard a patch puts at the top of an Instagram
 * method comes first there and is made once, because two guards stacked on one hot method is what
 * broke Froggo's builds; a filter several of Instagram's methods pass a value through is called
 * once in each of them; the settings patch's hooks sit in the application's onCreate and the main
 * activity's onNewIntent; and no ShortcutManager call the settings patch sends to the extension is
 * left in Instagram's code. A start-call, next-call, sole-call, once-call or shared-call rule names
 * its method by the strings it loads, and a shape where strings alone don't tell it apart, and
 * exactly one of the app's methods may answer that: on Facebook 580 five methods held one string a
 * rule named, so a rule naming it alone passed a hook in any of them. A method that loads no string
 * at all, such as the send of Instagram's store of stories you've seen, is named by the strings its
 * class's methods load between them and its shape among them (class-holding), and exactly one may
 * answer that too. Where a sibling shares the method's shape, the rule can add a call the method
 * makes (calling): the story player's resume reads the clock and the stub beside it doesn't. The
 * device verifier stays the authority; these catch the known shapes without a phone.

     * One rule about the whole APK.
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>"single-call &lt;method reference&gt; in &lt;caller method name&gt;": exactly one call
     *       site, there.
     *   <li>"first-call &lt;method reference&gt; on &lt;class&gt;": the method calls a method of
     *       &lt;class&gt; that takes no arguments before its first return or throw. A stub the
     *       patch filled does; one still answering its marker doesn't.
     *   <li>"first-call &lt;method reference&gt; on-type-named &lt;GraphQL type&gt;": the same, where
     *       the class is the one whose {@code getTypeName()} answers &lt;GraphQL type&gt; as a
     *       literal. For an accessor on a class Redex renames, which no contract can name, and
     *       exactly one class may answer the type.
     *   <li>"first-call &lt;method reference&gt; outside &lt;class prefix&gt;": the method calls a
     *       method of a class whose type doesn't start with &lt;class prefix&gt;, whatever it takes,
     *       before its first return or throw. For a stub the patch fills with a call to a method it
     *       found by what the method does, whose class is a Redex name and no model answering a type
     *       name. A stub still answering its marker makes no call, and one whose only call stays in
     *       the extension doesn't leave it.
     *   <li>"start-call &lt;method reference&gt; [in [static|instance] &lt;shape&gt;] holding
     *       &lt;string&gt; [&lt;string&gt; ...]": exactly one method outside the bundle's own code
     *       loads every one of the strings, a space in one written as \s and a backslash as \\, and has the shape, a
     *       descriptor such as {@code (Landroidx/fragment/app/FragmentActivity;*)V} where * stands
     *       for any run of characters, or inside a class name for any run within that name, so
     *       {@code (L*;)V} takes one object and nothing else. A string written as a field reference, such as
     *       {@code Lcom/example/Kind;->REPORT:Lcom/example/Kind;}, is held by a method that reads or
     *       writes that field, for a method that loads no string of its own. That method calls the method reference, with nothing before
     *       the call but plain instructions (no other call, branch, switch, return or throw), and
     *       no other method loading the strings calls it.
     *   <li>"no-call &lt;method reference&gt; outside &lt;class prefix&gt;": no class but those whose
     *       type starts with &lt;class prefix&gt; calls it. For a call the patch sends to the
     *       extension everywhere, where the extension makes the real one and a call left anywhere
     *       else would undo what the patch is for.
     *   <li>"next-call &lt;method reference&gt; after &lt;method reference&gt; [in [static|instance]
     *       &lt;shape&gt;] holding &lt;string&gt; [&lt;string&gt; ...]": exactly one method outside the
     *       bundle's own code loads every one of the strings and has the shape, as for start-call.
     *       That method calls the first method once, no other host method calls it, and the
     *       instruction just before the call calls the second method, on the same first register.
     *       For a hook sent in place of one call of a known pair, so it can't drift onto another
     *       view, another call or another method holding the same strings.
     *   <li>"sole-call &lt;method reference&gt; replacing &lt;method reference&gt; [in [static|instance]
     *       &lt;shape&gt;] holding &lt;string&gt; [&lt;string&gt; ...]": exactly one method outside the
     *       bundle's own code loads every one of the strings and has the shape. It calls the first
     *       method once and the second not at all, no other host method calls the first, and that
     *       call reads the registers, in their order, that the clean build's one call to the
     *       second method there read. For a hook that takes one call's place: left out or left
     *       beside the call it stands in for, the call it replaces still happens, and on other
     *       registers the hook gets the wrong values.
     *   <li>"once-call &lt;method reference&gt; [in [static|instance] &lt;shape&gt;] holding &lt;string&gt;
     *       [&lt;string&gt; ...]": exactly one method outside the bundle's own code loads every one of
     *       the strings and has the shape, as for start-call. That method calls the method reference
     *       once, anywhere in its body, and no other host method calls it. For a hook that has to
     *       read what the method made first, so it can't come first, and follows no one call.
     *   <li>"retry-call &lt;method reference&gt;" with the same selection clauses: once-call's checks,
     *       plus the exact typed null-selection backedge before the pending key is claimed. The
     *       selected local reaches the native builder, and no branch bypasses selection.
     *   <li>"story-loop-call &lt;native method reference&gt;" with the same selection clauses:
     *       the finished-story guard invokes that exact method with invoke-direct/range on
     *       p0 and p1. The original handler keeps its own call to the same method.
     *   <li>"shared-call &lt;method reference&gt; [in [static|instance] &lt;shape&gt;] holding &lt;string&gt;
     *       [&lt;string&gt; ...]": exactly one method outside the bundle's own code loads every one of
     *       the strings and has the shape, as for start-call. That method calls the method reference
     *       once, anywhere in its body, and no other method loading the strings calls it. Methods
     *       that don't load them may call it too. For a filter the patches put in more than one of
     *       the app's methods, each picked by a rule of its own, such as the one every link parser
     *       passes its link through: once-call would count the other parsers' calls against it.
     *   <li>Any of those five with "class-holding" in place of "holding": the strings are held by
     *       the method's class, its methods loading every one of them between them (a field
     *       reference by one reading or writing it), and the method is the one with the shape
     *       among the methods with code of every such class outside the bundle's own code. Exactly
     *       one may answer, and the kind's own checks follow as written. Where start-call and
     *       shared-call look for the hook in other methods loading the strings, they look in the
     *       methods that load them all themselves, so a sibling that loads none may make the same
     *       call. For a hook in a method that loads no string at all, as the patches put in the
     *       send of Instagram's store of stories you've seen and in both record methods of its
     *       batch of watched reels.
     *   <li>Any of those five with "calling [static|instance] &lt;method reference&gt;" after the
     *       shape, or in its place, and before "holding" or "class-holding": a method has the
     *       rule's shape only when it also makes a call whose method reference matches that one,
     *       a * in it standing for any run of characters, or inside a class name for any run
     *       within that name, as in a shape. "static" counts only an invoke-static, "instance"
     *       only any other invoke, and neither word any invoke. Everything else about the rule
     *       stays as written. For a method that shares its strings and its shape with a sibling
     *       that doesn't make the call, as the story player's resume does with a stub beside it,
     *       and the home tab's static method with a few others taking a session.
     *   <li>A once-call or shared-call rule with "sites &lt;n&gt;" after its calling clause, or where
     *       that would go, and before "holding" or "class-holding": its method calls the method
     *       reference exactly n times, 2 or more, rather than once. For a filter the patch puts on
     *       each of several reads in one method, as Hide the home feed does on both helper reads in
     *       the read of Home's store.
     *   <li>Any of those five with "pooled" right before "holding" or "class-holding": a method
     *       also loads a string when it asks a static (int)String pool of shared strings for it, the
     *       number put in the call's one register by the instruction just before the invoke-static.
     *       The pool's first switch case loading a string for a number decides which string it is,
     *       as the patches' classesLoadingString reads them. For a rule whose patch finds its method
     *       that way, since Redex pools a string in some builds of one version and not in others
     *       (385611395 and 385611400 ask a pool for the story link parser's type name, which 438
     *       loads itself). A rule without it counts literal loads only, so a pooled ask elsewhere
     *       can't give it a second method.
     *   <li>Where start-call and shared-call look for the hook in the other methods holding the
     *       strings, a method that another picking rule for the same method reference picks, as
     *       its one method of the rule's shape, isn't one of them. Two rules told apart only by
     *       their calling clause, as the two touch methods of the list ViewPager2 makes are, each
     *       hold their own method to the hook and leave the other's alone.
     * </ul>
