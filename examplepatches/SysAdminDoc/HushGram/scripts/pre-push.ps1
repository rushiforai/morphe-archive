.SYNOPSIS
    Checks a push before it leaves the machine.

.DESCRIPTION
    This project builds nothing on GitHub, so a push is the last point at which anything can be
    checked. Called by .git/hooks/pre-push with the remote name and URL, reading the pushed refs
    from standard input the way git supplies them. Run scripts/install-hooks.ps1 once to wire it up.

    Every push gets the commit checks: who committed each published commit, trailers or authors
    naming an AI tool, and tracked files that name the maintainer's machine or a phone. A tag, or
    a commit that adds or changes patches-bundle.json (the index Morphe Manager reads), is a
    release, and a release needs HUSHGRAM_ALLOW_RELEASE=1 set for that one push. A push that moves
    a PowerShell file has every tracked one parsed, and one that doesn't parse stops it.

    When a pushed commit changes the build, the patches, the extension or a root file their tests
    read, the tip is checked out into a clean worktree and built there: the unit tests, both lints,
    the catalog regenerated and compared, the bundle, and every declared build patched when
    HUSHGRAM_FIXTURE_DIR holds it. A change to the verification scripts or their contract and
    allowlist files counts as a build change too, so the declared builds are verified again with
    them. The ledger's rules run when the ledger or its scripts move, and the injected-register,
    device helper, resource table and release tooling suites when their own files move.

    The build waits for a slot in the machine's build queue and holds it to the end, and Gradle
    runs through the machine's wrapper (scripts/build-jobs.ps1 says how both are found). Without
    them it runs straight away with a warning. HUSHGRAM_ALLOW_RELEASE=1 puts the push ahead of
    everyday builds in the queue.

    Before the gate removes its worktree it keeps what a release needs, pass or fail, in a folder
    named for the commit (scripts/gate-evidence.ps1 says where): the test results, the bundle and
    its SBOM, each declared build's reports and passing patch run, and a manifest. The release
    receipt and the release check read them back with -FromGate rather than building, testing and
    patching the same commit again. A push whose files are all index files, over a commit the
    gate passed with nothing since but the index's own lines, isn't built or tested again. Its
    release check still runs, and a gate here that would patch the declared builds needs the kept
    run to have patched the same fixtures with the same desktop CLI.

    A push that changes a published file (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, the catalog, the version, the
    bug form, the index or the lists and scripts the release check reads) runs
    scripts/validate-release-facts.ps1 on the pushed tip: in place when the checkout is a clean
    copy of it, otherwise in a clean worktree. The index push that follows a release is held to the
    published release itself (-VerifyPublishedAsset), so it has to come from a clean checkout of
    the commit it pushes, with the receipt build-release-receipt.ps1 wrote beside it. Set
    HUSHGRAM_SKIP_PRE_PUSH=1 to push anyway.
