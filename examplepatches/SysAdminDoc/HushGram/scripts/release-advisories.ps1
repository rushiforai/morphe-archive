<#
.SYNOPSIS
    The advisory gate: what OSV knows about the libraries a release's SBOM lists, and whether the
    release may go out with them.

.DESCRIPTION
    Taken from Hushfacebook's scripts/release-advisories.ps1
    (https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/Hushfacebook, commit 814acd23d7b70d5d23abce6cb6c97767e16a051e).
    GPL-3.0-only. Modified for HushGram (Instagram), 2026: resolved dependency-scope validation
    and a publisher-reviewed Guava supplement, separate from shipped-payload certification.

    Dot-sourced by build-release-receipt.ps1 and validate-release-facts.ps1, beside
    release-receipt.ps1, whose Read-ReleaseSbom reads the SBOM these functions take.

    Gradle's dependency verification (gradle/verification-metadata.xml) says an artifact is the one
    somebody checked the hash of. It says nothing about the advisories published against that
    version since, and the libraries a bundle carries are chosen by conflict resolution several
    levels down, so nobody reads them one by one. This asks OSV (https://api.osv.dev/v1/query)
    about every library the SBOM lists, one query per package URL, and refuses a release that
    carries a high or critical advisory.

    High or critical means an applicable label says so or a CVSS 3 vector scores 7.0 or more.
    Unread, malformed or ambiguous severity is held for review even beside a lower label.
    Package-specific ratings belong only to the queried package/version. CVSS 4 is not scored
    here and needs review. Consistent moderate and low advisories are printed and let through.

    An advisory can be accepted in scripts/advisory-exceptions.txt for one package, until a date
    at most 90 days out, with the reason it doesn't apply to what the bundle does with that
    library. An exception past its date covers nothing, and one that matches no advisory any more
    fails the run, as the manifest allowlist does: an exception that outlives its advisory stops
    being a review.

    OSV has to answer. A query that fails, or an answer this can't read, stops the run rather than
    reading as no advisories. -SkipAdvisoryCheck is the way through for offline work, and it says
    so in a warning. The pre-push hook never passes it, so the index push that hands a release to
    Manager users asks OSV again.

function Read-AdvisoryExceptions {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        The accepted advisories, one per line: "<advisory> <group>:<name> <yyyy-MM-dd> <reason>".
    .DESCRIPTION
        The advisory is OSV's id or one of its aliases (a CVE, say). The date is the last day the
        exception holds on this computer's calendar (-Today defaults to the local date, not UTC's),
        at most 90 days after -Today, so accepting an advisory means reading it
        again at least that often. The reason is at least three words: an exception is a claim
        about how the bundle uses the library, and a claim nobody wrote down can't be checked.
        Blank lines and # comments are ignored. A line in any other shape stops the run, naming
        it, rather than being skipped: a skipped exception would fail the release for a reason
        nobody could see in the file.
        -Scoped requires a reviewed tooling scope before each line. The same advisory in another
        scope needs its own review; payload exceptions keep the original format.
