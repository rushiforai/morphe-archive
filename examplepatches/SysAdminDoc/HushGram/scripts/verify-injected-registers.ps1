.SYNOPSIS
    Check what the bundle injected into Instagram against the shapes that fail on a device.

.DESCRIPTION
    A patch that writes into a register beyond the method's register count, branches into the
    middle of an instruction, passes an invoke the wrong registers or reads a parameter as the
    wrong kind assembles without complaint and applies without complaint. The desktop CLI reports
    it as applied. It fails only when a device verifies the class, and then it fails as a
    VerifyError on whatever screen happens to reach it first.

    Two checks, either of which catches that:

    Static. scripts/DexDiff.java lists every method the patched APK does not share with the
    clean build it came from, and holds each line that was not in the clean body, and every
    line of every added method (the extension's and the helpers patches add to Instagram's own
    classes), to that method's register count. Every changed and added method is also checked
    for a register past its count, the upper half of a wide value included, for branch and
    switch targets, invoke registers, the static and wide parameter layout, move-result
    placement and try ranges, and the whole APK is held to
    scripts/injected-mutation-contracts.txt: the ad guard and the build expiry guard each first
    and once in the method that puts an ad into a feed and the one that shows the expired-build
    lockout, the analytics address filter once in the address builder, the share link filter once
    in each of the two share link parsers, the extension's context and the settings screen's hooks
    once each in the application's onCreate and the main activity's onNewIntent, and none of
    the five ShortcutManager calls the settings patch reroutes left in Instagram's code. Each
    guard sits in the one method its rule's strings and shape pick out.

    On a device. The Android runtime's own verifier is the authority, so with -Serial the
    clean APK and the patched APK are both put through dex2oat with the verify filter and the
    verifier's messages are compared. The patched build has to raise exactly the same message
    multiset as the clean build. An emulator works too: its x86_64 dex2oat verifies for arm64.

    Removed host methods and DEX entries fail the static check. The allowlist beside this script
    accepts only exact reviewed removals, and a stale entry fails so an old exception cannot mask
    a later regression.

    Both halves refuse to pass on absent evidence. A dex comparison that found no difference at
    all compared the wrong things, and a device run only counts once dex2oat has read a file of
    the size that was pushed (it exits 0 on a missing one). The clean side has to be Meta's own
    build of the same version as the patched one: a patched APK on the clean side would compare
    two bundles instead of the bundle against Instagram.

    The static half compares the whole clean bundle, merged the way the CLI merges it before it
    patches (Get-MergedApk), because the patched APK carries what the splits brought as well as
    base.apk's code: 449's in-app browser ships its own dex in split_heliumcore.apk, three dex
    entries in the merge, and against base.apk alone its methods would read as added (Facebook
    580's, the same browser, read as some 12,000 added and 212 changed). The merge carries no
    signature, so Meta's signer is checked on base.apk, DexDiff holds the merge to base.apk's
    classes*.dex byte for byte (handed base.apk as its last argument), and it fails a clean side
    that holds any of the bundle's own code. The device half runs base.apk, the same app code.

.EXAMPLE
    scripts/verify-injected-registers.ps1 -PatchedApk C:\work\patched.apk

    The clean side is the fixture of the same version in the folder HUSHGRAM_FIXTURE_DIR
    names, an .apk or the .apks bundle Instagram ships as. A bundle is merged here unless
    -CleanMerged hands over its merge (verify-all-patches.ps1 has made one to patch).

.EXAMPLE
    scripts/verify-injected-registers.ps1 -FromDevice -Serial $env:HUSHGRAM_DEVICE_SERIAL
