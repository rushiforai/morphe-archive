/**
 * Helper for the "Hide group buttons on the share sheet" patch.
 *
 * <p>The share sheet puts a New group button beside its search bar. Depending on a server value it's
 * a button of its own, built from a stub, or an action inside the search box, and either way one
 * method of the sheet reveals it once the sheet is set up. The patch asks {@link #hideGroupButton}
 * first thing in the method that builds the button, so the stub is never built and takes no room,
 * and {@link #hideGroupAction} first thing in the method that reveals it, which then turns the
 * search box's action off instead. Once you pick people, the bar under the sheet can also offer to
 * send to them as a group, and the patch asks {@link #hideGroupSend} before it shows that button.
