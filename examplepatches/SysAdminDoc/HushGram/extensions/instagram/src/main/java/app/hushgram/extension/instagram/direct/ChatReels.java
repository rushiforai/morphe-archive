 * Helper for the "Swipe through a chat's reels" patch (#350).

 * <p>Instagram already knows how to chain the reels shared in a chat, behind a server test. With
 * the test on, a reel opened from a chat takes the chat's other shared reels along into the Reels
 * viewer, so swiping up goes through the ones shared there before Instagram's suggested reels, and
 * Back still lands in the chat. The patch answers the test's one read through {@link #chain(int)}.
