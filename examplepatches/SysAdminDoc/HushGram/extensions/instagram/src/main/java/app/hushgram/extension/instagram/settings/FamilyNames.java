 * The name each patch goes by in Morphe Manager, which is also the family its hooks report
 * under in Hook status.
 *
 * <p>Compile-time constants, so a hook that names its family inlines the text and loads no
 * class. That matters for the hooks that can run before HushGram has a context, such as the
 * signature read Instagram makes while its content providers start: touching {@link PatchFamily}
 * there would load the settings with no context to read them from.
