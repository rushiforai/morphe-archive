/**
 * What the Clean up Reels patch asks before a part of the Reels viewer is drawn.
 *
 * <p>The viewer's overlay is built from components, each drawn by its own render method, and a
 * render that answers nothing leaves its part out. Instagram does that itself whenever a part has
 * nothing to show. The patch asks one of these first thing in each render it hides:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #hideFollowButton} in the Follow button beside a reel's author. The Follow button
 *       on the cards of suggested accounts between reels is another component and stays.
 *   <li>{@link #hideChips} in each pill that prompts you to make something or promotes something:
 *       the attribution pills for Edits, templates and creative tools, the Stories template pill,
 *       the Meta AI pill, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses pills and the affiliate link. The other things
 *       Instagram puts above a reel's author, a live badge or a state-controlled media label, have
 *       components of their own and stay.
 *   <li>{@link #hideSocialFooter} in the inline comment preview and the row of friends who saw
 *       the reel, and in Instagram's check for putting the bubbles of friends' likes, comments and
 *       follows above the author, which then answers no. It's also asked first thing in the use
 *       case that works out a reel's floating bubbles, which then answers that there are none.
 *   <li>{@link #hideSocialContext} in Instagram's check for leaving out a reel's social context
 *       line, the faces with Liked by or Followed by beside them, with the line's type. The check
 *       answers yes for {@link #FRIENDS_ACTIVITY}, so a follower count or a seller's rating stays.
 *   <li>{@link #hideCommentBar} first thing whenever the controller of the Add comment bar under a
 *       reel opened outside the Reels tab would show it, once it inflates the bar, and when it
 *       would put the bar back after hiding it for a while, with where the viewer was opened from. It answers yes for a profile's reposts, {@link #REPOSTS}, and
 *       Instagram's own hide then takes the bar off. The reel's comment button stays.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Every hook fails open: until the settings are ready, while HushGram is paused, with a switch
 * off, or when something throws, Instagram draws the part.
