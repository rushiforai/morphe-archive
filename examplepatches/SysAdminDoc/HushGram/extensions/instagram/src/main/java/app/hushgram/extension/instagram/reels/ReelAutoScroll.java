/**
 * Helper for the "Keep Reels auto scroll on" patch.
 *
 * <p>Instagram 449 asks one method whether auto scroll is on in Reels: the scroller that moves on
 * to the next reel reads it, and so does every auto scroll switch Instagram draws. Where the answer
 * comes from is a server choice: a value kept in memory, which every start forgets; a timer you set
 * when you turn it on; or a saved preference, which Instagram itself clears whenever you leave
 * Reels in one setup. The Reels viewer's state and its picture in picture read the value in memory
 * themselves. The patch passes every answer of that method, and every one of those reads, through
 * {@link #answer}, every answer of the saved preference's getter through {@link #saved}, and hands
 * each choice made with Instagram's own switches that turn it on or off to {@link #chosen}, and
 * again to {@link #stored} once Instagram has kept it in memory or saved it. A completed duration
 * choice passes its actual expiration timestamp to {@link #timerSet} after the native save, so a
 * future timer is remembered even if it expires before another check answers on.
 *
 * <p>HushGram keeps the last choice ({@link Settings#REEL_AUTO_SCROLL_ON}). The check answering on
 * is remembered as on, a choice Instagram keeps is remembered as it is, and turning auto scroll off
 * with one of Instagram's switches is remembered as off. While the switch is on, Instagram's "off"
 * is answered with what's remembered, so auto scroll stays on across restarts and leaving Reels
 * until you turn it off, and Instagram's own switches show that answer. The memory follows
 * Instagram while the switch is off too, so turning the switch on later goes by your latest choice.
 *
 * <p>An "on" read back from the saved preference is never remembered. In the memory and timer
 * setups Instagram doesn't go by it, and turning auto scroll off there doesn't clear it, so an old
 * "on" saved by the Reels tab's long press would otherwise turn auto scroll back on as soon as
 * anything read it. Where Instagram does go by the preference, its switches' handler saves the
 * choice there, which reaches {@link #stored}, and the check reads it through the getter, so its
 * "on" reaches {@link #answer} too.
 *
 * <p>Paused, before the settings are read, or when anything goes wrong, Instagram's answer stands
 * and nothing is remembered. {@link #answer} runs every time the scroller checks, so it reads a
 * saved value and writes only when the choice changes. No hook throws.
