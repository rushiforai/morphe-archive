/**
 * Download in the menu of a feed post with a video, and with its second switch, of a photo post.
 *
 * <p>Instagram's feed menu has a Download row of its own, but only on your own posts, and a tap
 * fetches a copy with a watermark. The patch adds the same row to anyone else's post and changes
 * what a tap does:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The menu's builder calls {@link #offer} where it starts on the rows for someone else's
 *       post. With the switch on, a post with a video gets Instagram's Download row there. On a
 *       carousel, that's the page on screen.
 *   <li>The short menu most of the feed opens shows only the rows whose option is on a fixed list,
 *       in the list's order. The method that makes the list hands it to {@link #allow}, which puts
 *       Download first with the switch on.
 *   <li>Your own post gets Instagram's row through {@link #ownPost} and {@link #ownPostRow}
 *       whenever a tap would save something, not only when Instagram allows its own download and
 *       keeps it in this menu rather than the share sheet.
 *   <li>The menu's handler asks {@link #save} first when Download is tapped, which saves the video
 *       from the addresses its Media already holds, through {@link MediaSave}. A post without a
 *       video goes to Instagram's own download.
 *   <li>With the photo switch on, a post or carousel page without a video gets the same row, and a
 *       tap saves its picture at the largest size, the way {@link StoryDownload} saves a photo story.
 *   <li>A carousel also has Save all. It snapshots every ordered page for one cancellable batch,
 *       respecting the photo and video switches while Download still saves the page on screen.
 *   <li>With Download video covers on, a post, or carousel page on screen, with a video gets
 *       Download cover, which saves the still picture Instagram shows before the video plays, as
 *       Download cover on a reel does (#94). It's offered after Save all, and the short menu keeps
 *       it after Download and Save all.
 *   <li>With Open in another player on, a post, or carousel page on screen, with a video file gets
 *       a row that hands the file to a player picked from Android's chooser ({@link ExternalPlayer}).
 *       It's offered next to Save all, before the builder splits into your own and others' rows,
 *       and the short menu keeps it after Download, Save all and Download cover.
 *   <li>With Details on, every post gets a Details row there too ({@link PostInfo}), kept last of
 *       these in the short menu.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Every hook fails open: until the settings are ready, while HushGram is paused, with the switch
 * off, or when something throws, the menu is Instagram's own.
