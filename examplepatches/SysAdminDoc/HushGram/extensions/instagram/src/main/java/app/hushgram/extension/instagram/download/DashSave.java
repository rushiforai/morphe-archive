 *
 * <p>A DASH manifest keeps the picture and the sound in two files. One plain fetch gets each file.
 * Then {@code MediaMuxer} copies the samples of both into one file, or {@link Mp4Join} does for a
 * picture the muxer won't write ({@link #ownWriter}). Neither decodes or encodes them again. So the
 * file has the quality that the player streams, and the join takes less than a second.
 *
 * <p>The two tracks and the result go into the cache of the app first, because the muxer must seek
 * in its files. Only the finished file goes into the gallery, through the same
 * {@link Downloader.Sink} as all other saves. So an error at any step leaves nothing in the gallery,
