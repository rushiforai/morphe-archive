/**
 * The play button a tap started a video from, kept out of sight while that video plays.
 *
 * <p>Instagram draws the play button on a feed video, a reel in the feed and a carousel page with
 * Litho, from the state the post was drawn with, and draws the post again only when something
 * about it changes. A tap on the button starts the video without changing anything the post is
 * drawn from, so the button stayed over the video it had started. The view-based button Instagram
 * uses elsewhere hides itself on a tap. This does the same for the Litho one: the tapped button's
 * view goes invisible, and comes back when the start it asked for ends (a pause, or another video
 * on its player), when no start comes of the tap within {@link #CLAIM_WINDOW_MS}, or when Litho
 * takes the view off the screen, since Litho hands a view it took off to the next thing it draws.
 * One button is hidden at a time, as Instagram plays one feed video at a time.
 *
 * <p>The click hands the start to Instagram before the hook hears of it, and Instagram usually
 * starts the video inside that call, so a start that came after the tap and before the click
 * returned is the button's as much as one that comes after it.
