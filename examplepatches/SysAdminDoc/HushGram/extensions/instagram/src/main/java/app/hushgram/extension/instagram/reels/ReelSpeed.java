/**
 * Keep the reel speed: the speed you lock with Instagram's own 2x lock (hold the edge of a reel, then
 * slide down, and Instagram says "Locked at 2x speed") stays for the next reels.
 *
 * <p>Instagram 449 keeps a lock on the reel it was made on. The Reels viewer's player controller sets
 * a reel's speed through its setPlaybackSpeed, a hold at the edge sets the hold speed there, and a
 * lock leaves the reel playing at it. The next reel's player starts at normal speed, and nothing
 * carries the lock over: the menu that could, Instagram's variable playback speed, isn't offered.
 *
 * <p>The patch tells this class every speed set through that setter ({@link #speedSet}), each lock
 * ({@link #lockedUp}), each end of a lock and why ({@link #lockUpEnded}), and each hold let go of
 * without a lock ({@link #holdEnded}). A lock keeps the speed the reel was set to last. The
 * controller's maybeResumePlayer hands over the reel ({@link #item}) and then its player
 * ({@link #resuming}) just before it plays it, and a reel that isn't an ad gets the kept speed then.
 * Instagram's own reset of the reel's speed, after a lock or a hold and on every scroll to the next
 * reel, is handed the kept speed in place of normal ({@link #resetSpeed}). That reset sets the reel
 * being scrolled to, an ad too, so an ad is set back to normal speed when it starts.
 *
 * <p>Sliding the lock off, or Instagram ending it from the speed menu, forgets the speed, and so does
 * a hold at the edge let go of without a lock: that hold ends at normal speed, and the next reels
 * start there too. Scrolling to the next reel or switching tabs ends Instagram's lock but keeps the
 * speed. Ads play at normal speed, as Instagram plays them. The speed lives in memory only, so it's gone when Instagram
 * restarts, and nothing is kept or set while the switch is off, HushGram is paused, the settings
 * aren't ready, or anything here fails.
