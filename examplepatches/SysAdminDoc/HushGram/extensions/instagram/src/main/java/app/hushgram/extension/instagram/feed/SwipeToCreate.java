/**
 * Helper for the "Stop swipe to create" patch.
 *
 * <p>Home sits in a container that slides sideways: the camera lies past its start edge, at -1,
 * Home at 0, and whatever Instagram puts past the other edge at 1. Every move of the container goes
 * through one method, whether a finger drags it, lets go of it or a button sends it, and each move
 * says why it happened. A finger's moves say {@link #DRAG}. The patch hands each move to
 * {@link #hold} just before the container slides.
 *
 * <p>While the switch is on, a drag from Home or the far panel toward the camera is held at Home,
 * so the camera never opens from a swipe. The + button and the other ways into the camera send
 * their own reasons, and a swipe that starts in the camera (back to Home) starts below 0, so both go on as
 * before.
 *
 * <p>The hook fails open: with the switch off, HushGram paused, the settings not read yet or
 * anything thrown, the move goes where Instagram sent it.
