/**
 * Helper for the "Keep a seek bar on Reels" patch.
 *
 * <p>Instagram 449 puts its seek bar under an ordinary reel only when the reel is at least as long
 * as a server setting says. A shorter one gets no bar, or one that stays hidden until you hold the
 * reel. The patch hands each of Instagram's reads of that setting for ordinary reels to
 * {@link #minSeconds}, which answers one second while the switch is on, and its read of whether
 * ordinary reels get the hidden kind to {@link #lazy}, which answers no. Ads have settings of
 * their own, read in the same places, and the patch leaves those reads alone.
 *
 * <p>The bar shows the time only while you drag it. {@link #progress} runs with every change of
 * the bar's position or length and keeps a label of the time played and the reel's length beside
 * it ({@link ReelTimeLabel}). Instagram uses the same bar for ads and could use it elsewhere, so
 * {@link #bind} hears from the binder that ties a seek bar container to a reel whether that reel
 * is an ad, and only a bar in a container bound to an ordinary reel gets the label.
 *
 * <p>Off, paused, before the settings are read, or when anything goes wrong, Instagram's own
 * answers stand and the label is hidden. None of the hooks throws.
