/**
 * Saves a photo or a video from the addresses the app already holds, without asking the app to do
 * it.
 *
 * <p>This is Hushfacebook's MediaDownload without its Facebook hooks. What a hook read out of the
 * app (the single files a post names, the DASH manifest its player streams, who posted it) is
 * handed in as plain values: a list of {@link Rendition}s, the manifest's text or null, and
 * {@link PostDetails} for the file name. So the hook that reads an Instagram reel's
 * {@code video_versions} and {@code video_dash_manifest} only has to call {@link #saveVideo}, and
 * everything after that (the pick against the Download quality, the join of a DASH picture and its
 * sound, the checks on every address, the gallery row, the notification with Cancel, the toast at
 * the end) is here and app-agnostic.
 *
 * <p>The caller hands over the item that was tapped, and nothing else. There is deliberately
 * <b>no static holding the last address seen</b>. Meta's apps prepare the next reels while the
 * current one plays, and anything remembered rather than passed in saves the wrong video and still
 * reports success.
 *
 * <p>No switch is read here. The patch that calls in owns its switch and checks it before it calls;
 * the Download quality, the folder, the file name and Saves other apps can open are read per save.
 *
 * <p>Every step goes to the diagnostic report under Downloads, and to logcat as
 * {@code morphe: MediaSave}. Addresses are logged as kind of file and quality only.
