/**
 * Download in every reel's more menu.
 *
 * <p>Instagram has a Download row of its own there, which it shows only on reels whose owner lets
 * other people download them, and which fetches a copy with a watermark after asking Instagram's
 * server. The patch keeps that row and changes who shows it and what a tap does:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Each builder of the menu asks {@link #offer} with Instagram's answer to whether the reel
 *       may be downloaded, and, in the builders that also read a server flag that holds the row
 *       back, {@link #withhold} with the flag. With the switch on, every reel gets the row. A
 *       builder that hands Download straight to the menu's adder of one row asks {@link #offerRow}
 *       and {@link #withholdRow} instead, which also let it in for Open in another player.
 *   <li>The menu's handler asks {@link #save} first when Download is tapped. With the switch on,
 *       the reel is saved from the addresses its Media already holds, through {@link MediaSave},
 *       and Instagram's own download never starts. A photo the Reels viewer shows with its music
 *       has no video at all, so it saves its picture at the largest size instead (#71). A carousel
 *       there saves every page, in order (#78).
 *   <li>The menu's adder of one row asks {@link #rows} first for Download. A photo that comes with
 *       music gets two rows in its place, Download as video and Download as photo, as a photo
 *       story with music does. As video builds an MP4 of the photo with the post's part of the
 *       track ({@link MusicVideo}), and the handler hands a tap on either row to {@link #save} too.
 *   <li>With Download cover on, a reel with a video gets two rows of ours in Download's place,
 *       Download and Download cover. Download saves the reel as Instagram's own row would, and
 *       Download cover saves the still picture Instagram shows before the reel plays, its image
 *       versions at the largest size (#48). A frame of the video is never a stand in.
 *   <li>With Open in another player on, a reel with a video file gets Download and Open in another
 *       player in Download's place, after Download cover when that's on too. A tap on it hands the
 *       file's address to a player picked from Android's chooser ({@link ExternalPlayer}). With
 *       Download on reels off, the row goes above Instagram's own Download row where Instagram
 *       shows one, and that row stays Instagram's. Where Instagram shows none, Download is let in
 *       for the adder all the same, which puts the player row alone in its place.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Every hook fails open: until the settings are ready, while HushGram is paused, with the switch
 * off, or when something throws, the menu is Instagram's own.
