/**
 * The stories you tapped Mark as seen on while viewing anonymously, and what became of each.
 *
 * <p>A story is known by its media ID, the digits Instagram's id for it starts with. Instagram keys
 * each story in a batch of views by that ID, its owner's and its reel's, joined by underscores, so a
 * batch's stories are matched to marks by the first part of their key. A key of any other shape is
 * never matched, and that story stays held back.
 *
 * <p>Everything here belongs to the account it happened on, by Instagram's user ID for it: a mark
 * made while signed in to one account is never sent in another account's batch, and a story one
 * account held back is never sent for another. With no account to go by, nothing is marked, kept
 * or sent.
 *
 * <p>When a batch goes to be sent, {@link #choose} picks the stories in it that are marked, and the
 * ones an earlier batch held back that have been marked since, and puts them, and nothing else, in a
 * new batch of Instagram's that started empty. Each story picked counts as sent: its mark is spent,
 * and if it turns up in a batch again it's held back like any other. Sent means handed to
 * Instagram's send, which may still fail on the network. A mark whose story isn't in the batch stays
 * until a send carries it, for 24 hours after the tap at most. Marks, and what was sent, are kept in
 * memory only, so they also lapse when Instagram's process ends.
 *
 * <p>Batches are held back whole while views are anonymous. So a story you mark after its batch went
 * can still go out, the stories of each batch held back while the button is on are kept here, up to
 * {@link #MAX_HELD} of them for 24 hours, and a tap on one of those sends it straight away.
