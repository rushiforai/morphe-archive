/**
 * Helper for the "Hide suggested posts" patch.
 *
 * <p>The patch passes every item Instagram's home feed parse helper reads through {@link #filter},
 * beside Hide Reels in the feed's filter when both are in. Suggestions are items of their own kinds: a row
 * of accounts to follow is one of the {@link #ACCOUNT_UNITS}, and a single post or reel from an
 * account you don't follow, labeled "Suggested for you" or "Suggested Reel", is an
 * {@link #SUGGESTED_POST}, which carries its post inside it. A post from an account you follow is a
 * MEDIA item and stays. Threads' units ({@link #THREADS_UNITS}) bring in posts, communities and
 * accounts from Threads, a survey ({@link #SURVEY_UNITS}) asks you to rate what you saw, and the
 * {@link #SHOPPING_UNITS} offer products. Each comes back as null while its switch is on, and every
 * caller of that
 * helper skips a null item, the home feed's page loads and its cache of recommended posts alike.
 *
 * <p>Explore's grid doesn't go through that helper (S22, Instagram 449), so it keeps its posts.
 *
 * <p>Hide videos, Hide photos and Hide carousels filter by the post an item carries, whoever posted
 * it, so they sit on Home's own reads ({@link #homeItem}) rather than that helper, which Explore's
 * chain of posts and the shop and ad feeds read through too.
