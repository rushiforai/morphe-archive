/**
 * The time label of the "Keep a seek bar on Reels" patch: "0:10 / 0:55" above the end of the
 * reel's seek bar.
 *
 * <p>Instagram's reel seek bar keeps the reel's position and length in milliseconds as its
 * progress and max, and every change of either reaches its onProgressChanged, where
 * {@link #update} runs. Only a bar whose container Instagram bound to an ordinary reel gets a
 * label ({@link #bind}): an ad's bar, or the same kind of bar anywhere else, stays as it is. The
 * container is the nearest view above the bar that Instagram bound, for the reel's tag too, so a
 * bar a view or two further down still counts.
 *
 * <p>Each bar gets one label, made with its first update and kept by the bar itself for as long as
 * the bar lives, along with one listener for the bar's layout, its window and the window's frames.
 * The label goes in the nearest view that has room for all of it above the bar's track:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>When that's the bar's own parent and a FrameLayout, the label is a child of it. TalkBack
 *       reads it, and it takes no touches, so a drag that starts on it still reaches the bar.</li>
 *   <li>Otherwise it goes on the overlay of the bar's parent or of a view further up, which draws
 *       over that view without joining its children and never takes a touch. A Litho host lays
 *       out only what it put there itself, and Instagram 449's scrubber container, a FrameLayout,
 *       is hardly taller than the bar, so a child label there was cut in half on a phone.
 *       TalkBack can't reach an overlay, so on Android 11 and up the bar itself carries the
 *       label's words as its state.</li>
 *   <li>When no view near the bar has the room, there's no label rather than a cut-off one.</li>
 * </ul>
 * A view holds at most one of these labels: a label whose bar has gone from under it gives way.
 *
 * <p>The label shows only while its bar does: while the bar and every view above it are shown, and
 * faded as much as the views between the bar and the label's holder are. That's checked before
 * every frame, so a container Instagram hides or fades without moving the bar hides the label too.
 * It's hidden while you drag the bar, when Instagram shows its own times, and when the bar has no
 * length. When the bar leaves the window, its label is hidden at once and taken off its holder
 * right after, and its text and width start over when the bar is bound to another reel, which
 * shows as a new length or a new reel tag on the bar's container.
 *
 * <p>Runs on the main thread, where a SeekBar calls its listener.
