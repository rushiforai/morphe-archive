// One Bouncy Castle version across every module, because the request arrives in more places
// than any single module can see. The patcher pins 1.77 and the Android build tools ask for
// 1.79, and both are inside CVE-2025-8916 (1.44 to 1.79) and CVE-2026-5588 (1.49 to 1.84);
// the reviewed release is the one gradle/libs.versions.toml pins, which says why it is that
// one. None of this reaches the payload injected into Facebook. It is the build and signing
// classpath, and the repository's rule is that a known-affected component does not stay in a
// reproducible graph.
//
// Per module this was applied twice and still missed three graphs: :extensions:shared's release
// runtime classpath, which has no force of its own, and two configurations the Android plugin
// makes for itself. The settings classpath is forced separately in settings.gradle.kts, which
// resolves before this file exists.
