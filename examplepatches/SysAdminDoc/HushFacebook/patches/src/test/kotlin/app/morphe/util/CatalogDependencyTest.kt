 * The dependency list in the shipped catalog is a set, so it reads like one.
 *
 * <p>Two CAPTCHA rows used to say `["Settings", "BytecodePatch", "BytecodePatch"]`, which reads as
 * two dependencies and is one, and every row's order was whatever the traversal produced, so an
 * edit to one patch could reorder rows it had nothing to do with and make the catalog diff say
 * more than the change did. The generator deduplicates and sorts now; these cases are what says
 * the catalog in the tree actually went through it.
