/**
 * Hide Menu promotions takes Meta's other products out of the Menu; this takes the pushes for them
 * out of everywhere else, each behind its own switch, all off until they're turned on: the Edits
 * button and badge in the Reels composer's header and the Edits pill under feed videos, the Threads
 * cross-posting onboarding in the composer, the Threads button in the share sheet, the Meta
 * Verified offer sheet after you post and the label under some posts' headers, the avatar sticker
 * promotions in comments and Facebook's own promotion slots, and Meta AI's Imagine: the Imagine me
 * button under posts, the post composer's Imagine and Create story's Imagine tile, plus the other
 * Meta AI buttons under posts. Posting, the other ways to share and ordinary stickers are untouched.
 *
 * Every anchor is a kept class name, an enum constant's name or a literal (see
 * MetaUpsellAnchors.kt, ImagineAnchors.kt and ShareSheetAnchors.kt), and every one is required.
 * The hooks ask the extension, which answers Facebook's own way until the settings are ready, while
 * paused, and whenever it fails.
 *
 * Off by default: nobody has seen it on a signed-in account yet.
