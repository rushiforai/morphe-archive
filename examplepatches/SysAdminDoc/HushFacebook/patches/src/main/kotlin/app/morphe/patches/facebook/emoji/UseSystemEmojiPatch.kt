/**
 * Facebook draws the emoji in its text with Meta's own emoji font, which it downloads and hands out
 * from one provider (see EmojiTypeface.kt). The provider asks the extension first thing and
 * answers with what it gets: the phone's default typeface while the switch is on, whose font
 * fallback ends in the phone's emoji font. Anything else, the switch off, a pause, settings not
 * ready yet or a failure in the extension, comes back as null and the provider's own code runs.
 *
 * A chat's big emoji is a picture Meta serves, drawn with the provider's typeface only until it
 * arrives. The maker of those pictures' addresses asks the extension first thing too, and while the
 * switch is on it answers no address, which Facebook takes as an emoji Meta has no picture of: the
 * chat keeps the emoji drawn with the provider's typeface. Otherwise the maker's own code runs.
 *
 * Reactions and stickers are pictures of their own, not text in a typeface, so nothing here
 * reaches them. Neither does androidx EmojiCompat, which Facebook starts with Google's downloadable
 * Noto font and which only fills in an emoji the phone's font doesn't have.
