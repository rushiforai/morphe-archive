 * Copyright 2026 Andrew Liang (GPL-3.0).
 *
 * Modified for Hushfacebook (Facebook), 2026: the instance-of chain moved into the extension's
 * feed filter, behind the shared feed hook. The patch still refuses a build that carries none of
 * the unit classes, so a rename fails at patch time instead of filtering nothing, and names each
 * one a build lacks in the patch log. It also finds the
 * story's recommendation flag, held to Facebook's own filter, the People you may know and
 * suggested groups type names, and the flag Facebook's own Discover unit reads to tell a row of
 * Stories you might like from other rows of Stories, which four more switches read. The People you
 * may know switch also reaches the carousel on your own profile, through a hook in that section's
 * children builder.
