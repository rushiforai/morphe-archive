/**
 * The share sheet's item list hook, shared by Hide Meta upsells (its Threads switch) and Share
 * sheet items (the picked items). The method that picks a sheet's items answers through the
 * extension's ShareSheetItems, which runs each patch's rule only when that patch was picked, so the
 * build carries one hook whichever of them are in. See ShareSheetAnchors.kt for how it's found.
