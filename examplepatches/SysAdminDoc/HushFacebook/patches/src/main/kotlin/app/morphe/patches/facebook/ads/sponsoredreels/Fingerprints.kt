/**
 * Reels and Watch get their ads from two families of insertion. One runs when a page of videos
 * loads; the other three fire on their own while you are already scrolling, each fetching a single
 * ad and splicing it into the live item collection. Only the first is a chokepoint, so all four are
 * neutered.
 *
 * Every one of these methods returns `void` and does nothing but insert an ad and tell the
 * controller its data changed, so returning immediately is safe. Each also opens a trace section
 * after the point of injection, never before, so no section is left unbalanced.
