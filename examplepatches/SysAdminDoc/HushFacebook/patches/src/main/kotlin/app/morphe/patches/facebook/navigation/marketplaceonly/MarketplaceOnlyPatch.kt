/**
 * Leaves Marketplace, Notifications and the profile or Menu tab in Facebook's tab bar, and opens
 * Facebook on Marketplace. The tab bar filter (TabBarAnchors.kt) asks the extension about each tab
 * as Facebook builds the bar, and the extension's MarketplaceOnly says which tabs go and when it
 * leaves the bar alone.
 *
 * It brings Open on a chosen tab with it: the start from the launcher icon goes to Marketplace
 * through that patch's route, which also gets Facebook's own start-up to use the tab.
 *
 * Included in the default selection, with its runtime switch off until the person opts in.
