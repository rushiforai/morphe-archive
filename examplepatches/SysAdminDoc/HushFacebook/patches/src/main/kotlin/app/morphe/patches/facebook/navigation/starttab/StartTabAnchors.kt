/*
 * How Facebook picks the tab its main screen opens on, on the 577 and 580 builds.
 *
 * The launcher icon starts com.facebook.katana.activity.FbMainTabActivity, through the manifest's
 * LoginActivity alias. Its tabs are subclasses of com.facebook.navigation.tabbar.state.model.TabTag
 * (FeedTab, WatchTab, FriendRequestsTab, MarketplaceTab, NotificationsTab, BookmarkTab, FeedsTab
 * and more), names Redex keeps, and each hands TabTag's constructor a long: the tab's bookmark id,
 * 1606854132932955 for Marketplace on both builds. The extension's FacebookTabs holds the ids.
 *
 * One method picks the start tab from an intent. It takes the context, the intent and the user
 * session and answers a tab id. When the intent carries the extra "target_tab_id" and the tab bar
 * has that tab, that's the answer. When the bar doesn't have it, the answer is the bar's first
 * tab, Home. With no such extra, the answer comes from Facebook's own rules. The kept
 * com.facebook.startup.destination.StartupDestinationRouter and several warm-up jobs ask it too,
 * but only to decide what to fetch early.
 *
 * The picker's answer doesn't decide the tab on a cold start by itself. The main screen's
 * creation runs a list of named start-up steps, and three of them stand between the launcher's
 * intent and the tab that shows:
 *
 * 1. "sanitize_intent" replaces the intent of a start another app sent with a new one that keeps
 *    only its action, its link and three extras, unless it carries a PendingIntent Facebook made or
 *    has no extras. A launcher is another app, so the tab asked for goes with the rest. Facebook's
 *    own tab shortcuts put the tab in a link for that reason, and its notifications carry the
 *    PendingIntent. The patch hands the step's copy to the extension, which asks for the tab
 *    again when it asked for one in the first place.
 * 2. "setup_main_view_controllers" asks the picker about the (now sanitized) intent, keeps the
 *    answer as the main screen's start tab and gives it to the tab bar. The tab bar's
 *    "TabBarController.determineStartingTabPosition" then uses it only when one of Facebook's
 *    MobileConfig booleans says so, and otherwise opens on the configuration's own first tab. On
 *    an account where that setting is off, a notification or shortcut that reaches a tab does it
 *    later, through the same deep link route onNewIntent takes. The patch puts the extension after
 *    that boolean read, which answers yes for a start it asked a tab for.
 * 3. After the tab bar is set up, the main screen puts its own start tab back to the default
 *    unless a static check agrees the intent asked for exactly that tab (and two more of
 *    Facebook's settings allow it). The patch passes that check's answer through the extension
 *    the same way, so the screen's idea of its start tab matches the tab that shows.
 *
 * None of this necessarily runs inside Android's onCreate. FbFragmentActivity.onCreate, where the
 * route hook goes first, hands on to the screen's delegate, and on a cold start the main screen's
 * instantiateDelegateImpl can hand out a stand-in that queues every call ("product_delegate_enqueued_")
 * behind a splash screen until the app is ready. Android then creates and resumes the screen, and
 * the queue replays the real delegate's onCreate, with the three steps above, afterwards.
 *
 * Every other start keeps Facebook's own answers: the extension says yes only while the main
 * screen it asked a tab for is being built, decided from that screen's own intent, and only for a
 * plain start from the launcher icon. The MobileConfig ids differ between builds, so no hook
 * anchors on one.
