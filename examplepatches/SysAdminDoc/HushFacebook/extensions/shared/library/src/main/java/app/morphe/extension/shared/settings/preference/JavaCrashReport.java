/**
 * Keeps the Java crash that ends the app for the diagnostic report's [LATEST JAVA CRASH] section.
 *
 * <p>Android keeps no stack trace for a Java crash: its exit record says CRASH and nothing more, so
 * a report sent after "Facebook keeps stopping" (#94) couldn't say what stopped it. The pause
 * module's uncaught-exception handler hands each crash here before passing it on. The trace and
 * the last diagnostic events go through the redactor and stay in Facebook's own files, so every
 * report exported after it carries them, until the next crash replaces them or the diagnostic log
 * is cleared. While the app's crash file switch is on, the same text also goes to a file in
 * Download/Hushfacebook ({@link CrashFile}), for a Facebook that crashes before settings open.
 *
 * <p>The handler sits in front of Facebook's own, so it also sees an exception one of Facebook's
 * swallows. When the handlers after it return, the process lives on, and an exception off the main
 * thread puts the report back as it was ({@link #survived}) and takes its file back, so it can't
 * push out a crash from an earlier start. One swallowed on the main thread stays: that thread is gone, and Facebook freezes.
 *
 * <p>Each save answers its own {@link Saved}, so a swallowed exception takes back only what it
 * wrote. While another thread's crash saved after it is still waiting on its handlers, the report
 * is that crash's, and it stays. Clear diagnostic data takes the waiting saves out with the report
 * ({@link #clear}), so one that lives on after it can't write a cleared report back.
