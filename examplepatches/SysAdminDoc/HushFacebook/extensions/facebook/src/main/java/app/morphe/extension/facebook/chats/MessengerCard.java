/**
 * What the Hide the Get Messenger card patch asks before Facebook's Chats shows its "Get the
 * Messenger app" card.
 *
 * <p>Facebook drops the card by itself when Messenger is installed, but it counts Messenger only
 * when Messenger is signed with Facebook's own key. A re-signed Facebook never matches, so the card
 * stays at the top of Chats with Messenger right there. The patch runs {@link #hide} first in the
 * question the card's plugin answers before it shows, and answers no for Facebook while the switch
 * is on and Messenger is installed and enabled, whoever signed it.
 *
 * <p>Whether Messenger is installed is looked up once per process start and kept. The manifest's
 * queries already let Facebook see it (Messenger has a launcher activity, and Facebook asks for
 * every app with one), so no permission is added. It fails open: with the switch off, a pause,
 * settings that aren't ready, Messenger missing or disabled, or any failure in here, Facebook asks
 * its own question and the card keeps its install path.
