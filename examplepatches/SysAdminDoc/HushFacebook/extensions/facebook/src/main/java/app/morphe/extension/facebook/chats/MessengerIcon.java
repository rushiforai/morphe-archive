/**
 * What the Open Messenger from the top bar patch asks before Facebook handles a tap on its
 * Messenger icon.
 *
 * <p>The icon at the top of the feed and of the other tabs opens Facebook's own Chats. The patch
 * runs {@link #open} first in the icon's tap, and in the Messenger button handler the older title
 * bar shares with it. While the switch is on and Messenger is installed, a tap starts Messenger's
 * launcher entry, the intent its home screen icon sends, and Facebook's own handling is skipped.
 * Any app may start a launcher entry, so nothing about the key Messenger is signed with matters.
 *
 * <p>It fails open: with the switch off, a pause, settings that aren't ready, a long press (Facebook
 * has its own use for that), no Messenger with a launcher entry, a start Messenger turns down, or
 * any failure in here, Facebook handles the tap as it always did.
 *
 * <p>A long press comes in two ways. Where Facebook gives the icon a long-click listener, which a
 * MobileConfig flag decides, the tap is told so. Where it doesn't, the top bar takes a press held on
 * the icon as a plain tap once the finger lifts, and Facebook opens Chats for it. The tap can't tell
 * that one apart, so the patch also hands {@link #touch} every touch on a Facebook screen before
 * Facebook sees it. A tap that comes as the release of a finger held past the long-press time,
 * timed from that finger's own landing whatever other fingers do, is left to Facebook too.
