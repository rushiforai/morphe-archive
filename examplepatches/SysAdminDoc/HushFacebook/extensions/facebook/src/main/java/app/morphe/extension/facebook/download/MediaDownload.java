/**
 * Saves the picture or the video that the app is showing, without asking the app to do it.
 *
 * <p>Facebook ships a save feature and refuses to run it for most content. The refusal is not
 * about the address: the story or the reel is on the screen, so the app holds an address that it
 * can fetch. This takes that address and fetches it.
 *
 * <p>For a story that is the point of the whole thing. Facebook's own save runs a check for
 * licensed music first. On a story that has any, it shows a warning and then saves nothing,
 * whatever the user answers (issue #110). The patch replaces the body of that handler, so the
 * check never runs and the video arrives complete, with its sound.
 *
 * <h2>What the patch hands over</h2>
 *
 * <p>The object that holds the media, and nothing else. Each entry point is called with the object
 * of the item that the user tapped, so the file saved is always the item on the screen. There is
 * deliberately <b>no static holding the last address seen</b>. Facebook prepares the next reels
 * while the current one plays, and a measurement counted six of them built in about fifteen
 * seconds of scrolling. Anything remembered rather than passed in saves the wrong video, and
 * still reports success.
 *
 * <p>Every step goes to the diagnostic report under Downloads, and to logcat as
 * {@code morphe: MediaDownload}. Addresses are logged as kind of file and quality only.
