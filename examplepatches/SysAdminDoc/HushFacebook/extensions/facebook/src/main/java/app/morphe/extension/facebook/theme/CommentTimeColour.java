/**
 * The time on Facebook's older comment row, the one that sits left of Like and Reply (issue #138).
 * On a pure black AMOLED comment sheet one reporter saw that slot laid out but blank, while Like,
 * Reply and the reaction count showed in grey. The row's TimestampPlugin (a name Redex keeps) wraps
 * the time in one span whose colour is the theme attribute Facebook's own styles point at its
 * secondary text, read on the row's context, with SECONDARY_TEXT's token only as the fallback. No
 * account we test with is served that row, so the colour's source isn't proven. The patch hands the
 * colour here before the span is made, and in dark mode, with AMOLED or Material You in the build, a
 * colour too close to the page to read comes back as Facebook's dark secondary text, themed the way
 * every other secondary text is. In light mode, with AMOLED's Light background color row set, the
 * time is held the way light mode's other secondary text is ({@link AmoledTheme#lightNamed}), since
 * the sheet under it takes the row's colour (#214). Light mode otherwise, a build with neither
 * theme, and any colour that already reads come back as they were.
