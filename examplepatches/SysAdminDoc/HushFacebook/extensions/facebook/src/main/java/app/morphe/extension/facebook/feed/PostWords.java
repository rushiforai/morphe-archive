/**
 * The two lists behind "Hide posts with words you choose": the words and phrases that hide a post,
 * and the ones that keep it whatever else it says.
 *
     * <p>A list is stored as one phrase per line. Each phrase is plain text, matched by default
 * anywhere in a post's words, inside longer words too, with case and compatibility forms folded the
 * Unicode way (NFKC case folding), so "Spoiler", "SPOILER" and "ｓｐｏｉｌｅｒ" are one phrase. A
 * phrase means its own characters and nothing else. Optional whole-word matching prevents a
 * phrase's endpoints from cutting a Unicode word run.
 *
 * <p>A line written between slashes, such as {@code /colou?r/}, is a pattern instead: a regular
 * expression read by {@link PostPattern}, matched against a post's words as they are, capital
 * letters aside, on a step budget per post so no pattern can hang the feed. A list holds up to
 * {@link #MAX_PATTERNS} of them, each up to {@link #MAX_PATTERN_LENGTH} characters between the
 * slashes. A pattern that can't be read is refused when the list is saved, and left out of a list
 * read from the store, like any line out of bounds.
 *
 * <p>Both lists are bounded, whatever wrote the store: at most {@link #MAX_PHRASES} phrases, each
 * {@link #MIN_LENGTH} to {@link #MAX_LENGTH} characters, or one that's a word on its own (an
 * ideograph, a kana or Hangul syllable, an emoji), a phrase given twice counted once. A line
 * outside the bounds is left out rather than cut, and the settings row says how many were. The
 * two lists also share {@link #MAX_LIST_BYTES} of room, so both always fit in a settings file
 * whole. The row refuses a list with too many phrases, or one past that room, rather than cutting it.
 *
 * <p>The lists never leave the phone through Hushfacebook: no log line, diagnostic report or
 * request carries a phrase, only the counts.
