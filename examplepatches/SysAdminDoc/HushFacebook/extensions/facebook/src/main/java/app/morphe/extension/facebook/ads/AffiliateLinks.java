/**
 * The product cards of the shop links a creator attaches to a post to earn a commission. Facebook
 * shows the card in three places, and each place asks its own question first: the reel overlay
 * asks whether a reel gets its product card, the feed asks for the id of the server-built footer
 * under a post's attachment, and the comment sheet asks for the model of the card that floats over
 * the comment box. With the switch on, the first answers no and the other two answer null, which is
 * what Facebook gets for a post with no shop link.
 *
 * <p>The reel overlay has other shop cards beside the affiliate one: products tagged on the reel, the
 * creator's storefront and Shop similar, each a "Shop now" card above the creator's name. They are
 * kinds of the overlay's call-to-action list, and with the switch on the list comes back without
 * them.
 *
 * <p>The "Commission eligible" label is a disclosure and is left alone.
 *
 * <p>Off, paused, before the settings are ready, or when anything here fails, the answer is
 * Facebook's own.
