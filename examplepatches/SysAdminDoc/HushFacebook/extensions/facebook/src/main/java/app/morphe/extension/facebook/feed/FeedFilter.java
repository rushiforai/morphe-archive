/**
 * What the news feed guard asks about each edge before Facebook adds it to the feed.
 *
 * <p>The guard runs at the start of {@code FeedUnitCollectionManager.addNewEdgeToCollection},
 * the one funnel every news feed edge is added through. Answering true there makes the method
 * return false, which Facebook already handles: it logs "Edge not added to FUC" and carries on,
 * so a hidden post leaves no gap and logs no impression. An edge swapped in over another one
 * never passes the funnel, so the swap asks the same rules through {@link #hideSwappedEdge}.
 *
 * <p>Every feed filter shares this one guard. Two patches each prepending their own guard to the
 * same method is how FroggoMorphePatches ended up with branch targets that pointed into the wrong
 * code, so the patches here only switch their rule on and the rules live in Java.
