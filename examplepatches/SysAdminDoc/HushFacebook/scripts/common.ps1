.SYNOPSIS
    The helpers the release and verification scripts share.

.DESCRIPTION
    Dot-source this beside patch-target.ps1 and patch-report.ps1:

        . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'common.ps1')

    Each of these existed in two to four copies that had already drifted apart. The path guard
    was identical in three scripts; the cleanup helper recursed unconditionally in one and only
    on request in another; the version read appeared four times, twice without -LiteralPath; and
    the desktop CLI was looked up by two functions with different search orders, one returning
    $null and one throwing. Copies of a guard drift in the direction of whichever caller was
    edited last, which is the direction nobody checked.

        the same name. v0.43.0 shipped that jar, and on 2026-09-21 it happened again between the
        build and the index push. buildAndroid now ends by copying the finished bundle here, where

        build/libs without it, so a device build made after a patch change and a test run

        the patches module and its submodules (patches/src/main, patches/<submodule>/src/main,
        the compile-only stubs among them, whose constants can be inlined into patch code), the
        sources of every extension module (extensions/<module>/src/main and
        extensions/<module>/<submodule>/src/main), the Gradle files that shape them, the R8
        rules (*.pro at extensions/ and in each module, extensions/proguard-rules.pro being the
        one every extension's R8 step reads), and NOTICE, which :extensions:facebook compiles
        into the payload for its Licenses row. Build output is never under src/main, so it is not
        walked. build-release-receipt.ps1 refuses a bundle this finds anything newer than.

    .SYNOPSIS
        The APK whose manifest and resource table describe an app: the file itself, or the base

    .DESCRIPTION
        Facebook ships as a split bundle (.apkm), not as one APK, and aapt2 and the resource check
        read an APK. The base APK holds the manifest and the app's own resource table; the splits
        hold densities, languages and feature modules. An .apks or .apkm names it base.apk, an
        .xapk names it after the package, so the largest APK is the fallback.

        Both paths are resolved against PowerShell's location before .NET sees them, and the
        answer is a full path. .NET reads a relative path against the process's own directory,
        which a hook, a scheduled task or a session that moved with Set-Location leaves somewhere
        else: `-Apk fixtures\facebook.apkm` then named a file that wasn't there.

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        The one APK the desktop CLI patches: a split bundle merged the way the CLI merges it,
        written to -Destination, or the APK itself when it isn't a bundle.
    .DESCRIPTION
        morphe-desktop merges an .apkm, .apks or .xapk into <name>-merged.apk beside its output,
        patches that, and since 1.17.0 deletes it on the way out. The patched APK's resource table
        and manifest were rebuilt from that merge, so the checks compared them with base.apk
        instead, which lacks every resource the splits carry: on 580 the patched table held 7,588
        resources base.apk doesn't, and none of them was compared. So the scripts merge first,
        with the CLI's own merger and the arguments it passes (MergeSplits.java), and hand the CLI
        the merged APK, which it patches as it is. There is nothing else to fall back to, so a
        merge that fails or writes no APK throws. The extensions are the CLI's own list
        (BundleFormats); anything else goes to the CLI as it is.

        Git Bash. Setting it calls SetConsoleOutputCP, and in a process with no console (a detached
        start, a service) Windows PowerShell 5.1 turns that into "The handle is invalid." before git
        ever runs. pwsh 7 keeps the value without a console. So when the setter finds no console,
        the encoding goes into Console's own field instead, which the property hands back and 5.1
        decodes with (checked on 5.1.26100 on 2026-09-30, with the console on code page 437).

function Find-MachineNames {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        The lines of tracked files that name the maintainer's machine or a phone.
    .DESCRIPTION
        The working-notes folder .gitignore keeps out, the backup folders on the maintainer's
        machine that share its name, and an adb serial, a Samsung one being R5C and eight more
        letters or digits. Four fixture tests once fell back to one of those folders, which
        skipped quietly on every other machine and published this one's layout, and five scripts
        carried the test phone's serial. .gitignore is the one file allowed to name what it keeps
        out. Both patterns are built from parts, so the file holding them can't match itself.

        git grep reads bytes, so text in UTF-16 has patterns of its own: every letter followed by a
        NUL for little-endian, the way Windows PowerShell's > writes a file, or preceded by one for
        big-endian. They go through git grep's Perl regexes, which read \x00. A git built without
        them can't search, which throws like any search that doesn't run.

        With -Commit the files are read out of those commits, which is what a push publishes, and
        no worktree is needed: git grep reads them all in one pass and puts the commit in front of
        each hit, <commit>:<path>:<line>:<text>. Without it, the tracked files as they stand in the
        working tree. GIT_* variables are cleared for the search, so it reads the repository -Root
        names, and a search that doesn't run throws rather than reading as a clean tree. Every hit
        comes back as git grep prints it; none at all comes back as nothing, so callers wrap it in @().
