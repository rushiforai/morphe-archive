/*
 * The patcher's inline smali, checked.
 *
 * morphe-patcher's smali compiler never reads its tree walker's error count, so an instruction
 * whose register doesn't fit its operand is left out of the output instead of refused: p0 in
 * `iget-object v0, p0, ...` or `invoke-static {p0}, ...` when the method has more than 16
 * registers. A dropped hook call is silent; the patch applies, the dex verifies and the hook
 * never runs (found by the Hushfacebook anchor audit, 2026-09-26). These keep the patcher's names
 * and count what the compiler kept against the instruction lines the patch wrote, so a drop
 * stops the patch and names the method. Patches import these, never the patcher's own; a
 * contract test holds that.
