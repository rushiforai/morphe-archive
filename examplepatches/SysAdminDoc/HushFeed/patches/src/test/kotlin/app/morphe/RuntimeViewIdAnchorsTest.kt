/**
 * The view ids the extension looks up by name on the phone, held against every TikTok build the
 * bundle declares, each by the names that apply on it.
 *
 * <p>Those lookups happen at run time, so a renamed id used to surface as a switch that did nothing
 * on somebody's phone. Most of the names are the three character ones TikTok's build makes up, and
 * each build hands the same names out again, at nearly the same index, mostly to other views:
 * g6r is 0x7f0a2170 on both 46.9.3 and 47.0.3, the share sheet's on one and the like button's on
 * the other. Every name here exists in every retained build from 46.2.3 on, so a name that
 * resolves proves very little. What `view-id-anchors.txt` adds is an owner, a class with a real
 * name whose code loads the id. VideoDiggAssem loading g6r's id says g6r is still the like button,
 * and a build that hands g6r to something else fails here instead of on a phone. An id that only
 * layout XML sets is held through the layout instead: the feed cell's inflater loads the survey
 * layouts, and the survey card's id has to be one of the ids those layouts set.
 *
 * <p>The table has to list exactly the lookups the code makes, so it can't fall behind the code.
 * Older fixtures only report what they cover, since the bundle doesn't claim them. Each group
 * carries the declared build's name alone: when the bundle moves to a newer TikTok, the owner and
 * tell that held the old name find the new one, and the old build's name goes with the old build.
