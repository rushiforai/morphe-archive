/**
 * Every Java file the payload ships opens with a notice saying where it came from.
 *
 * <p>CONTRIBUTING requires a {@code Forked from:} URL on source derived from another project, and
 * requires that an existing notice is preserved when a file is modified or moved. Neither is
 * something a reader can check by eye across two hundred files, and on 2026-09-15 four files were
 * found to have been imported with a ReVanced notice and to have lost it since, three of them in
 * this fork. Morphe's own DMCA notice took 702 repositories off GitHub over attribution, so the
 * rule is worth a gate rather than a paragraph.
 *
 * <p>What counts is deliberately loose: any leading comment naming an origin. This is not trying
 * to police the wording, only to stop a file shipping with nothing at all. The one thing it is
 * strict about is that the notice comes first, because a notice below the imports is one a reader
 * opening the file does not see.
