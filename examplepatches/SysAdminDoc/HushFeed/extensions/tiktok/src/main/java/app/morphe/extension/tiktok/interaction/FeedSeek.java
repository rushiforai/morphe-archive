/**
 * Where the playing video is, and how to move it.
 *
 * <p>TikTok's {@code PlayerController} kept its name and so did the two methods that matter.
 * Its progress callback runs several times a second while a video plays and carries the
 * position, the length and the id of the video they belong to, and {@code getPlayerManager()}
 * hands back the player the seekbar drags. The manager's own {@code seek(float percentage)}
 * takes a percentage from 0 to 100, while progress positions and lengths are milliseconds.
 * Its name survived but the interface declaring it did not, so that one call goes through
 * reflection on whichever concrete class the manager turns out to be.
 *
 * <p>The id is the point. A post that never reports progress, a photo post or a paused ad,
 * leaves the last video's controller sitting here, and a press would move something that is
 * no longer on screen. So the seek says which video it means and is refused if that is not
 * the one the ticks describe.
