 * TikTok's own recovery from crashes at launch. On the third launch crash in a row it deletes
 * every preferences file whose name isn't on its keep-list, and Hushfeed's weren't on it: a crash
 * loop erased every setting, the Lab's rules and the Calm feed undo one start before Hushfeed's
 * safe mode could pause anything.
 *
 * <p>This runs where TikTok builds that list, which can be inside its crash handler and before
 * Hushfeed has a context, so it touches nothing but the array it is given. The names are
 * compile-time constants, and reading them loads none of the classes they come from.
