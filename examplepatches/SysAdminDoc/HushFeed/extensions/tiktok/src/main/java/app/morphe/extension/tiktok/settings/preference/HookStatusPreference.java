/**
 * Says whether the hooks found the app they attach to.
 *
 * <p>The patcher only knows what it wrote into the APK. Whether a hook then found its anchor at
 * runtime is a separate question, and when it does not the switch above still reads on while
 * nothing happens. This row answers that question before someone files a report about a feature
 * that was never running.
 *
 * <p>It speaks for the surfaces that report: the comments, the inbox, the share sheet, the feed
 * overlay, the feed models and the families listed in the README's Hook status paragraph. A
 * patch that reports nothing is not covered by it, so "everything found what it needed" means
 * everything that is watched, not every patch in the bundle. No count here: the last one this
 * said was eleven patches out of date.
