/**
 * The unread badges on TikTok's bottom tabs: the red count on Inbox and the dot on Profile.
 *
 * <p>Both are drawn by the tab icon view, and every show or hide of either goes through its own
 * setter (the count through {@code setCountDotVisibility}, the dot through
 * {@code setTabDotVisibility}); the callers that fetch the views themselves animate them and
 * never write a visibility. So the answer is taken in the setter: hidden, it is GONE whatever
 * TikTok asked for, and a repeated native update cannot bring it back.
