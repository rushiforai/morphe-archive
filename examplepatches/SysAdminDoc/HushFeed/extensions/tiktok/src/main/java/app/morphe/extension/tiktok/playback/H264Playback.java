/**
 * Plays the H.264 rendition of a video that also comes in ByteVC1 (TikTok's HEVC) or ByteVC2.
 *
 * <p>TikTok often decodes ByteVC1 in software even on phones with a hardware HEVC decoder, which
 * shows up as stutter on older chips and heat on newer ones. H.264 has a hardware decoder on
 * practically every phone. Each gear in the list the player chooses from carries its codec in
 * {@code SimBitRate.getCodecType()}, which every converter fills from the feed's
 * {@code is_bytevc1}: 0 is H.264, 1 ByteVC1 and 2 ByteVC2 on 47.0.3, 47.1.3 and 47.1.4. The
 * patch filters what reaches {@code SimVideo.setBitRate} and {@code SimVideoUrlModel.setBitRate},
 * the same doors Play SDR instead of HDR and Playback quality use.
 *
 * <p>A list without an H.264 gear goes back whole, so a video only offered in TikTok's own
 * codecs still plays as it did.
