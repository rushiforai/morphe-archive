/**
 * One document a settings row reads or writes through a file app, from asking for it to having
 * the answer.
 *
 * <p>A file app can take as long as it likes to hand a document over: a cloud one downloads it
 * first, and one that has hung never answers. Backup, restore and the watch-history import used
 * to do this on the shared worker pool behind a busy flag nothing else could clear, so a stalled
 * file app left their rows out of reach until TikTok was closed. Each read or write now runs on a
 * worker of its own, the file app is passed a cancellation it can honour, and after
 * {@link #stallMillis} the row offers to stop waiting.
 *
 * <p>Stopping can't interrupt code running inside the file app. It cancels the request, closes
 * whatever the file app handed over, and shuts the two gates the work passes: an import stopped
 * before {@link #commit()} changes nothing, and a backup stopped before {@link #publish()} is
 * never handed over. A worker the file app is still holding keeps its kind's slot until it
 * returns, so stopping and trying again can't pile up workers or open files behind a file app
 * that ignores the cancellation.
 *
 * <p>Public for the Feature Gate Lab, whose loaded-value files go the same way.
