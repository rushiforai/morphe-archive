/**
 * Save seen history to a file and Restore seen history from a file: the signed-in account's
 * seen videos written out in {@link SeenHistoryFile}'s format and merged back in later, on this
 * phone or another.
 *
 * <p>Both rows capture the account when they open the picker, keep it through a rebuilt
 * settings page, and act only while it's still signed in. A save reads the history on the
 * history worker, so the file is one moment of it. A restore reads and checks the whole file
 * before its gate, and the merge rechecks the account and the history's generation inside its
 * transaction: a stop before the gate, or an account switch before the commit, changes no
 * account's record. A file app that stalls is handled the way Back up and Restore handle one,
 * through {@link DocumentOperation}: a save the file app already has stays open, and the row
 * says so, until the write returns.
 *
 * <p>The file is the only place the ids go. Nothing here logs one, and settings backups never
 * carry the history.
