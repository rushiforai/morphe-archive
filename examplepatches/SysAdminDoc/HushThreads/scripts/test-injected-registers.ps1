.SYNOPSIS
    Exercise DexDiff.java against dex files that break one check each.

.DESCRIPTION
    BadDexFixture.java writes a clean host, a patched build of it that passes every check, and one
    patched build per check that breaks that check and nothing else: a branch into an instruction,
    a branch to itself, a switch case into an instruction, a switch pointed at the other kind of
    table, a branch or switch case onto a payload (a packed or sparse switch's, or
    fill-array-data's) or a move-result, flow that falls into a payload, starts at one or runs off
    the end of the code, an invoke with too few registers, a wide argument split across two
    registers, the static off-by-one, the upper half of a wide parameter read as an object, a
    narrow constant read as a long and the reverse (the Facebook sibling's AMOLED sweep bug on its
    580), either half of a live long overwritten and the other half still read, a broken pair or a
    narrow constant on one arm of a branch or on a loop's back edge, either half of a pair broken
    on one arm moved where the arms meet, a zero on one arm read as a long, a conflict (an object on one arm, an
    int on the other) read by each instruction and in each register that takes a value, or read
    through a copy, a wide move of a conflict, a long and a lone upper half tested against zero,
    an int and an object tested for equality in either order, a move-result the patch separated
    from its invoke, bad try ranges and handlers (a handler at a switch or array payload among
    them), and a move-exception the method's entry reaches. A register out of range fails as its
    own finding: named by a helper added to a host class, as the upper half of a long read from
    the last register, as a long an extension method writes there, and in a guard the patch put
    in a host method. Each of the five ShortcutManager calls the settings patch sends to the
    extension is left in the app's code by a build of its own, which has to fail that call's
    no-call rule and no other. The contract file may hold no no-call rule without such a build,
    and no rule of any other kind, since nothing here builds bad fixtures for one; a malformed
    line of every kind the grammar knows is refused.
    The good build carries the joins, copies and reads ART accepts, a zero tested against
    an object among them, so a check made stricter still has to pass them. Each bad build has to
    fail with findings of its own category only, so a check that fires for the wrong reason fails
    here too. Removed methods and DEX entries, the removal allowlist, and the device tally
    comparison are held to what they did before.
    verify-injected-registers.ps1 also runs end to end with stand-in tools, and its wiring is read
    through the parser (script-wiring.ps1), with the wiring checks themselves tried on copies that
    drop the calls but keep their text, at least one for each rule of what a script can't reach.
