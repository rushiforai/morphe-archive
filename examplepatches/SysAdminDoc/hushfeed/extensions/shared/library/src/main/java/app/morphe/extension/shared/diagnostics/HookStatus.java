/**
 * What each hook family found in this TikTok build, and what it did not.
 *
 * <p>The patches attach to code TikTok renames on every release, and a hook that no longer
 * finds its anchor fails quietly: the switch still reads on and the thing it promises simply
 * does not happen. Nothing told anyone, so the lookups report here and the Diagnostics screen
 * shows a family at a time.
 *
 * <p>Only lookups the caller has no fallback for belong here. Most readers try a getter and
 * then a field, or several shapes of row in turn, and expect most of those to miss. Neither
 * does a condition that varies from row to row: this says whether a build is broken, and a
 * single comment cell that came up without its thumbs down is not that.
 *
 * <p>Reporting runs on the layout callback of a scrolling feed, several times per pass, so an
 * answer already known has to cost a hash lookup and nothing else. No lock is taken on a
 * repeat, and the wording of a miss is composed only on the call that records it.
