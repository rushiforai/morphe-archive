/**
 * A feed that stays shut: For You, Following and the other feed tabs sit behind a calm panel and
 * their pager doesn't swipe, while Inbox, profiles and search work as they always do.
 *
 * <p>It is not a second hold. The daily budget's panel, its stopped playback and its pager block
 * already do all of this, so the lock is a second reason for them to be there: {@link
 * SessionLockOverlay} puts its panel up when either the budget is spent or this is on, the
 * pager's {@code onInterceptTouchEvent} and {@code onTouchEvent} turn swipes down through {@link
 * FinishLastVideo#holdsSwipe}, and {@link SessionPlaybackHold} stops the video under the panel.
 * A spent budget keeps its own panel, with its countdown, when both apply.
 *
 * <p>A link to one video still opens that video. TikTok starts the app on it with a link
 * (cold, through the main activity's creation, and warm, through its new intent) and plays it at
 * the top of the feed, where nothing tells it from a feed video but the intent that brought it.
 * So a link entry lets the first video that comes up stay uncovered, and the next video, by any
 * route, ends the exception. A video opened from a message, a profile or search is not on the
 * recommendation feed at all, so the panel never covers it.
 *
 * <p>The same link entry serves Open shared videos alone, a switch of its own that needs no
 * lock: the video a link opened plays by itself, with the feed's swipe turned down while it is
 * the one playing ({@link #linkVideoAlone}), so there is no next video to fall into. Another
 * video coming up by any route ends it, and so does TikTok coming back after {@link
 * #AWAY_ENDS_ALONE_MS} or more away, when the reader is back for TikTok itself and the link's
 * video may still be sitting at the top of For You. Only the pager the video came up in is held:
 * the other top tabs and the bottom Friends tab each have a pager of their own, and one of them
 * where nothing new starts playing, like a LIVE or a photo post, would otherwise not swipe at all.
