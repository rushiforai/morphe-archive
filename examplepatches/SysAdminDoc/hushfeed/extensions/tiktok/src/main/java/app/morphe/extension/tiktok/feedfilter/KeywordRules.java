/**
 * The blocked word lists, which are plain phrases plus two operators.
 *
 * <p>A phrase on its own still means what it always did: hide anything containing it. Two quoted
 * phrases joined by {@code &} mean both have to be there, and joined by {@code !&} mean the first
 * has to be there and the second must not. That is as far as this goes on purpose. The one fork
 * that took keyword lists further settled on the same two rather than regular expressions,
 * because a settings box is read by the person who typed into it.
 *
 * <p>A line that opens a rule and does not finish it is left out rather than matched literally,
 * and the row that holds the list says which line it was. Quietly treating {@code "cat" & } as a
 * phrase would hide nothing and say nothing about why.
