/**
 * Collapses TikTok's suggestion cells wherever they are bound.
 *
 * <p>"People you may like" has no one source. The inbox, Activity and New followers lists
 * have injectors that {@link InboxControls} answers, but the profile header, the Friends tab
 * and the feed's account cards each build their own list, and every one of those lists is
 * made of cells that extend {@code AbsRecUserCell}. Its bind is the one place they all pass
 * through, and this is called at the end of it with the cell, after TikTok has laid the cell
 * out: the Rect cells write their own top margin inside the bind, so a hook ahead of it would
 * have been undone. The cell is a RecyclerView ViewHolder, so its view is the real-named
 * {@code itemView}.
 *
 * <p>The cell is collapsed to nothing rather than only hidden: a GONE child of a horizontal
 * list still holds its width in some layouts, and its margins hold space in every layout.
 * Size, margins and visibility are remembered so a cell recycled after the switch goes off
 * comes back exactly as TikTok had it, invisible cells included.
