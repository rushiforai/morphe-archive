/**
 * The check mark a profile grid cell puts before its view count when its video is one Hushfeed
 * saved here ("✓ 12.3K"), and a feed video's creator row before its time ("✓ 2d ago").
 *
 * <p>Saved means in {@link SavedVideoArchive}'s record, which Check for already-saved videos
 * keeps. That record only takes saves made while the check is on, so the mark needs the check
 * too: with it off a save leaves no trace, and a mark that covered only the saves from before
 * would pass for one that covers them all. It's the same record the check offers Open or Save
 * again from, so a video deleted since keeps its mark until the record is forgotten, and photo
 * posts, which the record never takes, are never marked.
 *
 * <p>The grid binds its cells on the main thread, many in a frame, so this never reads the
 * database: the archive answers from the ids it holds in memory. They're read off the main
 * thread soon after TikTok starts ({@link #warm}, from the start's sweep) or, failing that,
 * when the first cell asks, and a cell bound before they're in stays unmarked until it's bound
 * again.
