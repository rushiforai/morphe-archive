/**
 * Whether a video says it may be duetted or stitched.
 *
 * <p>TikTok reads one number off the video and gives two different reasons for refusing on
 * it: 1 is the creator saying friends only, and 2 is the commercial one, a video carrying
 * music or a partnership that closes duets whatever anyone wants. Both duet and stitch use
 * the same two numbers. Only the first is answered differently here. Turning the second into
 * "anyone may" would put the upload in front of a wall it is meant to be behind, and it is
 * the case most likely to have the post taken down afterwards.
 *
 * <p>Every other reason the app has for refusing is a separate check on a separate value and
 * is untouched: a photo post, a private video, children's mode, a deleted video.
