 * <p>Two numbers are kept: how many different videos have come up, and how long the player has

 * the budget says so once and, if a hold was set, covers the feed until it runs out. Nothing
 * here touches the feed's own data, so TikTok never learns that anything happened and never
 * refetches a batch it already has.
 *
 * <p>The day ends at an hour of the reader's choosing rather than at midnight, because someone
 * still scrolling at one in the morning is having last night. The day only ever moves forward:
 * changing that hour, or crossing a timezone, must not hand back a budget that has been spent.
 *
 * <p>Everything survives the process being killed. What it must not do is cost anything to keep:
 * the player reports progress several times a second, the settings store commits synchronously,
 * and a record written on every report would be thousands of blocking writes an hour. So nothing
 * is counted at all until a budget is set, the record is written on a background thread, and the
 * watched time is only committed when it has moved by a meaningful amount.
