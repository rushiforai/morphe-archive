/**
 * Comment list tools: a keyword filter on loaded comments, and TikTok's thumbs down control
 * on each comment repurposed to block the commenter in one tap.
 *
 * Both entry points are called from the same places the comment translation patch hooks:
 * {@code BaseCommentCell} binding a cell, and the comment list response being handled.
 * The {@code Comment} and {@code CommentItemList} models keep their real names on TikTok
 * 46.2.3 ({@code getText}, {@code getUser}, {@code getCid}, {@code getReplyComments}, and
 * the public {@code items} list), so nothing here depends on an obfuscated name.
 *
 * The thumbs down is a RelativeLayout ({@code jlk}) holding an icon ({@code m3b}) at the
 * right end of the comment's action row; both ids were read off a live comment panel. TikTok
 * drives it with a touch listener installed once per view, the first time the cell binds, so
 * this class installs its own touch listener after the bind has returned, which replaces
 * TikTok's and survives every later rebind. The icon stays; a tap now blocks the commenter
 * (a second tap unblocks), the row dims and the icon tints while the account is blocked, and
 * an undo banner is drawn in the window the comments live in, because the panel is not
 * always in the activity's window and anything added to the activity's content root then
 * sits underneath it.
