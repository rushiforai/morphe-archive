/**
 * Tells whether the video feed is the screen currently on show.
 *
 * The block button is an overlay on the activity content root, and TikTok keeps Inbox,
 * Profile, Friends and Shop inside that same activity. Without this the button follows
 * the user onto every screen.
 *
 * The bottom navigation tabs carry their selected state, so the Home tab being selected
 * is a reliable and cheap signal. On 47.0.3 the bottom navigation ids are omq Home, omp
 * Friends, omm Create, omr Inbox, oms Profile.
 *
 * <p>Selected is not enough on its own. A creator's profile opened from the feed by the name
 * or the avatar is a page of the same horizontal pager as the feed, and the pager scrolls the
 * feed's page, bottom navigation and all, one screen width to the left, where the Home tab
 * stays VISIBLE and selected. So the tab also has to have pixels on screen, which
 * {@link View#isShown} does not check: it reads visibility flags up the tree and nothing else.
