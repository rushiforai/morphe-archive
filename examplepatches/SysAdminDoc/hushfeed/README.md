# Hushfeed

Hushfeed is a set of TikTok patches for [Morphe](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-manager). It cuts down accidental taps and gives you more say over what the app puts in front of you. It runs on the global TikTok build, `com.zhiliaoapp.musically`, version [46.2.3](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/tiktok-pte-ltd/tik-tok-including-musical-ly/tiktok-46-2-3-release/tiktok-46-2-3-android-apk-download/).

It started as a private fork of [icysymmetra's Metra patches](https://github.com/icysymmetra/tiktok-patches-for-morphe) and grew past them. Everything upstream ships is still here, along with the work from other community bundles and a long list of additions of its own. That comes to 70 patches, each with its own switch in a settings screen that follows your phone's language.

## What it does

- **Block from the feed.** One tap blocks whoever posted the video you're watching, with an undo banner. A second button hides that creator locally without contacting TikTok, and its searchable list can remove one entry at a time. Another button blocks the current sound. A Not interested button sits beside them.
- **Guard rails against accidental taps.** Follow and like need a second tap within four seconds. Sending a video to a friend from the share sheet does too. Long press and double tap can be remapped or switched off.
- **A quieter feed.** Hide ads, Shop, livestreams, LIVE replays, stories, image posts, paid partnerships, AI labelled videos, verified accounts, series, playlists, promotional music, videos you've already seen, and anything matching your own caption words, creator handles, locally hidden creator ids, sound names, length, publication age or engagement rules, the country it was posted from, or a pattern over creator names.
- **A quieter screen.** Hide the caption, the music line, the action column, survey cards, the status bar, the visual search prompt, the Live entrance, floating promotions and the CAPTCHA puzzles. Clear display can turn itself on after each video starts.
- **An inbox you choose.** A switch for every Inbox row and header control, stories tray, suggested accounts, message requests and conversations.
- **Comments on your terms.** Keyword and account filters, thumbs down that blocks the commenter, quick reactions and brand animations hidden, comments beside the video on wide screens, and translation through TikTok's own service.
- **Downloads worth keeping.** Pick the quality, save original photos, combine separate audio tracks when TikTok serves them apart, save subtitles as SRT beside the video, name files with tokens, choose a folder per media type, remove the watermark.
- **Playback the way you want it.** Default speed and a custom speed menu, quality choice with a separate cap on mobile data, stop looping, resume after scrolling, automatic advance, the native seekbar and its thumbnail, hold and slide for 2x.
- **Privacy.** Ghost mode stops story view, profile view and typing reports. Telemetry to ByteDance, AppsFlyer and Firebase can be switched off. Screenshots and Circle to Search work again.
- **Region.** SIM, locale and timezone presets, with an optional store region override.
- **Under the hood.** Feature Gate Lab exposes TikTok's own A/B flags with recording and typed overrides. Settings back up to a JSON file with restore, reset and undo. Diagnostics export a report.

## Install

1. Get the TikTok 46.2.3 APK. Google Play only offers the newest build, so take it from [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/tiktok-pte-ltd/tik-tok-including-musical-ly/tiktok-46-2-3-release/tiktok-46-2-3-android-apk-download/).
2. Use Morphe Manager 1.29.0 or newer. Manager refuses a bundle built against a patcher newer than its own, and this one is built against patcher 1.12.0, which Manager 1.29.0 was the first to ship. On anything older the bundle simply will not load.
3. Add Hushfeed as a source in Morphe Manager. The quickest way is this link on the phone: [Add Hushfeed to Morphe](https://morphe.software/add-source?github=SysAdminDoc/hushfeed). You can also download `patches-0.27.0.mpp` from the [latest release](https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/hushfeed/releases/latest) and load it as a local bundle.
4. Pick the patches you want and patch the APK. Keep the manager's existing signing key so TikTok stays logged in across updates. Every patch here fits the manager's 640 MB memory default except AMOLED dark theme, which rewrites TikTok's color resources and needs the limit raised to 768 MB. That 640 is the manager's default and not a measured minimum: the whole set apart from AMOLED fits in 576 MB. If patching stops with an out of memory error, that setting is the one to raise.
5. Install the patched APK. From 2026-09-30, phones in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand ask for more before they will install an app from a developer Google has not verified. The flow is the same every time: turn on the option in Developer options, unlock the screen, restart the phone, then wait 24 hours before the install goes through. After that it stays open for 7 days, or indefinitely if you chose that. This is not a one-off. Every Hushfeed release is an update, and an update goes through it again once the window closes. `adb install` from a computer skips the whole thing.
6. Open TikTok, go to Settings and privacy, and tap Hushfeed. Every patch you selected has its switches there.

The Settings patch adds the entry point and is selected by default. Deselect it and the other patches still apply, but their switches have nowhere to live. `patches-bundle.json` in the repository root is the source index Morphe reads for the published bundle.

## Patches

| Patch | Description |
|---|---|
| `Automatic video advance` | Keeps native automatic advance enabled, and shows TikTok's own Auto scroll action in the video panel for accounts that never had it. TikTok still checks pauses, dialogs, gestures and whether another video is available. Turn it off in Playback to stop advance started by this option. An optional session limit stops Hushfeed-owned advance after a chosen number of visible videos while manual and native-only scrolling remain independent. |
| `Foldable split comment view` | Enables comments beside the video from a configurable window width (600 dp by default). Off by default, with multi-window and picture-in-picture restrictions preserved. Restart after changing its settings or unfolding if TikTok keeps the old layout. |
| `Subtitle tools` | Saves captions as SRT files beside downloaded videos. Choose original, device or all available languages, adjust caption size and background, and keep the current caption visible in clear display. |
| `Playback quality` | Chooses the lowest, highest or a target video quality for regular and adaptive playback. A second choice caps quality on mobile data, and only ever lowers it. Download quality has its own setting. |
| `Advanced downloads` | Selects a video quality or target resolution and combines separate audio tracks when needed. Optional extras save Photo Mode images straight from their source URLs, keep a video's sound as its own .m4a, save a video without its sound, hand the link to a downloader you already use, and save a profile picture at full size or a story from a long press. Both gestures use the pressed view's current media, including individual stories inside a creator's collection. When the target is [YTDLnis](https://github.com/deniscerri/ytdlnis), choose its audio or video mode and whether the handoff runs in the background. Other package names receive only the sanitized link. |
| `Allow Duet and Stitch` | Ignores the creator's Duet and Stitch setting so the entries appear. Every other check the app makes still applies, and whether the upload is accepted is the server's decision. |
| `Keep the screen's refresh rate` | Stops TikTok asking the screen to run slower than it can, which it does by asking for the frame rate of the video. A request that is not slower than the screen is left alone. |
| `Fit the video to the screen` | Shows the whole of a video instead of cropping it to the window. Nothing changes on a tall phone. On a folding phone opened up, a squarer screen or a split view the sides or the ends stop being cut off. |
| `Notification controls` | Adds a switch for the notification saying somebody new followed you, and one for message streaks. The follower notification is dropped before Android is asked to post it; everything else in the drawer is untouched. |
| `Long-press controls` | Lets a long press on a video keep TikTok's own action, do nothing, open the video's comments, copy the link to the video or to its sound, or save the sound the video was made with, which is the whole original rather than the finished mix cut to the post. It can also turn a press on the left or right third of the screen into a jump back or forward by however many seconds you pick. Brings `Double-tap controls` with it, which supplies the comment control. |
| `Double-tap controls` | Changes feed double taps to do nothing or open comments for the current video. TikTok's normal action is the default. |
| `Confirm feed interactions` | Adds optional second-tap protection to Follow and the like heart. The red ring expires after four seconds and resets when the video changes. |
| `AMOLED dark theme` | Replaces the dark background palette with black or a chosen opaque color. Select the patch and its color in the patcher. Light theme colors stay unchanged. |
| `Always show publish date` | Keeps the video's publish date visible in its author information. |
| `Not interested button` | Sends feedback about the current video through TikTok's own service. The button works independently of the block switch. Changing either switch updates the controls immediately, and a daily-budget hold keeps them hidden. |
| `Block author button` | Adds a button to the video player that blocks the account that posted the current video in one tap, with an undo banner. A companion button hides the creator locally without a server call, and the Feed filter page keeps a searchable list for removing individual entries. Long press the block button to move it. A second button blocks the current sound. |
| `Comment tools` | Hides comments containing chosen words or from chosen accounts, and turns the thumbs down on each comment into a block button. A switch hides comments made of an image or a sticker rather than words, and another puts a box above the comments that narrows them to what you are looking for. Reply controls follow their parent comment; clearing or disabling search restores the rows it hid. |
| `Copy comments without username` | Copies only the comment text without including the creator's username. |
| `Custom offline videos limit` | Adds a custom entry to TikTok's offline videos menu with a configurable limit from 1 to 1000 videos. Values outside the range use the nearest valid limit. |
| `Disable login requirement` | Removes TikTok's mandatory login gate from supported flows. |
| `Disable the long press quick share` | Keeps long-pressing Share from opening TikTok's quick-share interaction. |
| `Disable the long press repost` | Keeps holding Like from opening TikTok's repost action without disabling TikTok's wider repost and upvote systems. |
| `Disable screen capture detection` | Prevents TikTok from detecting screenshots and screen recordings. |
| `Allow screenshots and Circle to Search` | Removes secure window flags and the native Circle to Search block. Off by default. Restart after changing the setting. |
| `Diagnostic tools` | Adds optional structured Morphe logs, TikTok crash capture, and clipboard or file report export. |
| `Downloads` | Adds watermark-free downloads, filename templates, and comment sticker saving. An animated sticker is written as MP4, GIF, or the WebP TikTok sent, whichever you pick. |
| `Show LIVE search` | Shows TikTok's search entry in the LIVE drawer where supported. |
| `Use non-personalized search` | Uses TikTok's non-personalized search mode instead of its saved account choice. |
| `Hide search suggestions` | Hides the searches TikTok offers on the search page before you type, and stops it fetching them. Your own search history stays. |
| `Feature Gate Lab` | Adds a searchable menu for viewing and overriding supported TikTok feature flags and configuration values. Client-side overrides cannot bypass server enforcement. |
| `Feature Gate Recorder` | Records gate reads while you use a feature, then shows new and changed values. An interrupted recording is discarded before the next baseline is taken. Save the full report as JSON or copy a smaller report. |
| `Follow diagnostics` | Reports the first refused follow and its reason each session, including nearby follows and follower removals. Optional diagnostics retains at most 160 requests. Refusal notices still work after that limit. Later profile readback stays paired with the same account and reports conflicting state without guessing the cause. |
| `Feed filter` | Hides feed ads, TikTok Shop items, livestreams, stories, photo posts, the playlist bar, the floating event badge, inserted cards, the countdown lock on short drama adverts, and videos outside configured view, age or like ranges, with optional filtering of cached and offline FYP fallback videos. After three fully filtered batches, Hushfeed shows bounded rejection reasons and a link to Feed filter settings. Sponsored cards are also dropped from the profile video viewer, the search grids and the Friends tab. |
| `Feed tab navigation` | Controls which loaded top and bottom navigation tabs remain visible, blocks newly added tabs when requested, and can hide the Tako AI bubble. |
| `Fix Google login` | Restores Google account sign-in after patching. |
| `Hide already seen videos` | Keeps a local record of what you have watched and drops those videos from later feed pages. |
| `Ghost mode` | Stops TikTok reporting that you viewed a story or a profile, or that you are typing. Online status is unchanged. |
| `Hide the risk control CAPTCHA` | Hides TikTok's risk control CAPTCHA dialog, raised by its BdTuring service, which the browsing CAPTCHA patch does not cover. Off by default. |
| `Hide comment popup ads` | Stops the brand animation that plays over the comment sheet when a comment matches an advertiser's trigger word or emoji. |
| `Comment sort controls` | Enables TikTok's full comment sort sheet. Top and Newest are available; With media and From creator appear when TikTok reports those categories for the post. Restart after changing the setting. |
| `Enable voice comments` | Turns on TikTok's own voice comment recording and publishing entry points for accounts that do not have them. Off by default, and selecting the patch is the switch. |
| `Hide CAPTCHA popups` | Hides non-account verification puzzle dialogs, including those shown while browsing LIVE. Account verification stays available, server checks are not bypassed, and a puzzle raised over a follow, like, comment or repost is always shown so those actions cannot fail in silence. |
| `Hide floating promotions` | Removes floating promotional badges, coin icons, and timer banners from the Home feed. |
| `Hide video overlays` | Hides the "Search this image" prompt over videos, the Live entrance in the top left corner, the caption, the music line, the action column on the right, the survey cards and the status bar, each with its own switch. Each of the six buttons in the right column has its own switch as well. |
| `Share sheet tools` | Adds a second tap before sending to a friend. Filters sharing apps and video actions before the panel builds, hides whole rows, and keeps the custom name list. Once a share sheet has been observed, the settings page lists its actions with readable labels and stable identifiers so they can be selected without typing native names. |
| `Hide feed LIVE button` | Stops the LIVE button at the top left of the feed from being built. Shares its switch with the Live entrance option. |
| `Hide feed follow button` | Hides the plus button under the creator's avatar on the action rail. |
| `Hide feed save button` | Hides the save button on the action rail. |
| `Hide feed search button` | Hides the search button at the top right of the feed. |
| `Disable telemetry` | Stops ByteDance AppLog analytics, AppsFlyer attribution, explicit Firebase screen reports and crash reporting from being sent. |
| `Hide suggested accounts` | Stops the suggested accounts list from being built on the Activity, New followers and Inbox pages. |
| `Hide inbox stories` | Stops the stories tray at the top of the Inbox from being built. |
| `Expand activity list` | Shows the whole Activity and New followers lists instead of stopping at a View all button. |
| `Hide inbox items` | Adds a switch for each row and header control on the Inbox tab, plus a Clear all control for suggested accounts. |
| `Hide quick comment reactions` | Hides TikTok's exposed quick emoji row in supported comment inputs. |
| `Hold-and-slide 2x lock` | Enables TikTok's native hold, slide down, and release gesture for locking playback at 2x speed. |
| `Open external links directly` | Opens profile and story website links in the system browser instead of TikTok's in-app browser. |
| `Playback speed` | Remembers the selected speed or starts every new video at a chosen default. The speed menu accepts up to eight choices from 0.5x to 3x, including 2.5x. |
| `Remember clear display` | Remembers clear display between videos, or enters it automatically after a chosen delay. Tap to restore the controls. |
| `Resume videos after scrolling` | Restores a video's prior playback position when returning to it in the feed. |
| `Region spoof` | Matches locale country, timezone and native region getters to the SIM preset while preserving the interface language. Store-region overrides have a separate experimental switch. IP address and server account rules still apply. |
| `SIM spoof` | Replaces SIM country and operator values reported to TikTok and provides country presets. TikTok may still use IP address, account history, language, and other region signals. |
| `Sanitize sharing links` | Removes tracking parameters from shared links, and can put a host of your choosing in place of tiktok.com so a link shows a preview where TikTok's own does not. |
| `Settings` | Adds the Hushfeed settings screen inside TikTok. The screen follows the phone's language where a translation exists; English, German, Indonesian, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese ship today. The Spanish and Portuguese tables have not been read by a native speaker yet, so corrections are welcome. |
| `Skip content warnings` | Adds an option to play videos TikTok has classified without the warning overlay asking to be tapped through first. |
| `Show author region` | Adds an option to show the country a video was posted from next to the creator's name on the feed. A second switch shows the creator's @handle in place of their display name. |
| `Show the progress bar` | Shows TikTok's own progress bar on videos where it would normally be hidden. |
| `Show the progress bar thumbnail` | Shows TikTok's video preview thumbnail while dragging the progress bar. |
| `Stop video looping` | Stops a completed video instead of automatically replaying it. |
| `Translate comments` | Adds comment translation controls using TikTok's translation system, with one in-flight request per loaded batch. |

## Settings tour

The settings pages use grouped controls on an AMOLED background. Light mode follows TikTok's theme, including the space behind the system bars, and larger text wraps across lines without clipping headers, captions or editor labels. Changing font size or navigation mode keeps the settings page you were using and its Back history. Use Search settings at the top to find translated titles or descriptions and jump to the original control. These screenshots come from native Android views rendered by the local test suite. Enabled controls and values are test fixtures.

Hushfeed saves what the app already has. The download reads the addresses TikTok itself fetched for the video you are watching, on the session you are already signed in with, so there is no separate request pretending to be a browser and nothing to keep in step with the site. That is the difference between this and a scraper. Through August 2026 yt-dlp had to rewrite its TikTok extractor twice and re-implement browser impersonation, and it broke again on 1 September. Cobalt has not shipped since April. None of that is a promise that saving always works. TikTok can change what it hands the app, and when it does the saver changes with the patches. It just means the thing most likely to break in a scraper is not part of how this works.


Select `Subtitle tools` in the patcher, then enable subtitle downloads in Downloads. Captioned videos and their SRT files share the same filename stem. Language names can use Unicode, and filename collisions keep separate tracks. Android 11 and later save the pair in Movies; Android 10 uses Download. The selected subfolder still applies. A failed subtitle transfer leaves the saved video intact and reports the partial result.

Caption appearance and the clear display option are in Interface:

<img src="assets/settings/interface.png" alt="Caption appearance settings" width="300" /> <img src="assets/settings/downloads.png" alt="Subtitle download settings" width="300" />

Inbox category switches identify New followers, Activity, Archive, Tako and Shop from native row data. They work with translated labels. Turning a switch off restores an already loaded row on the next layout.

<br>

Playback has an optional default speed for every new video. A manual choice lasts until you change videos. To add 2.5x, enter it in Speed menu choices and restart TikTok; an empty list restores TikTok's menu.

Select `Automatic video advance` in the patcher, then enable Advance when a video ends in Playback and restart. The option re-enables native auto-scroll if TikTok turns it off, and it puts TikTok's own Auto scroll action in the video actions panel, which otherwise only appears for accounts in that rollout. Use the Playback switch to disable it.

Auto-advance session limit is zero by default. A positive value counts videos that finish while Hushfeed started scrolling, not prefetches or manual swipes. Recreating the feed starts a new count; returning from the background keeps a reached limit stopped until the feed is recreated or the limit changes. Hushfeed shows a brief notice when it stops.

Advanced downloads can send a sanitized TikTok link to another installed app. Enter its package name in `Send links to another app`; an empty value keeps TikTok's own save. The [YTDLnis](https://github.com/deniscerri/ytdlnis) package is recognized explicitly as `com.deniscerri.ytdl`, so its documented audio or video type and optional background mode are available. The profile controls stay disabled for every other package, and an uninstalled target falls back to TikTok's save.

Foldable controls are in App behavior. Settings save immediately. A notification tells you when to restart TikTok.

Numeric feed limits show their actual unit with language-aware singular and plural labels.

Native settings pickers use one radio indicator for a single choice and one checkbox for multiple choices. The selected state remains accessible and is saved through Android's native list adapter.

<img src="assets/settings/behavior.png" alt="Foldable comment settings" width="300" />

Region spoof requires Override SIM details plus Match locale and timezone to country in Region settings. Each built-in country preset supplies a timezone. Country codes must be two ASCII letters. Locale scripts and extensions are retained, including when a legacy variant needs fallback handling. Restart TikTok after changing these settings. Enable the separate store-region option only if needed; it can affect search. GPS and the network address stay unchanged.

<img src="assets/settings/region.png" alt="Country and region settings" width="300" />

Playback has two switches for a feed that keeps going when nobody is watching it. One takes the sound while a comment sheet is open and gives it back when the sheet closes. The other holds the feed after you return to the app until you tap once, and leaves the tab bar alone so messages, a profile and search stay one tap away. Both are off unless you turn them on. These two switches request audio focus; they don't call the native player pause used by the daily-budget hold.

Playback also carries a daily budget for the feed, on builds that include the block author patch, which is where the hook that knows which video is on screen comes from. It is off until you put a number in it, and until then nothing is counted at all. Set a video count, a number of minutes, or both, and Hushfeed says once that the day is used up. Set a hold too and the current player pauses behind a countdown for that many minutes, with a way through it on the countdown itself for the times you decide otherwise. It resumes only when the held video is still current, the feed is visible and audio focus permits playback. The panel follows the tab row as the screen layout changes. Messages, profiles and search are untouched, and so is the feed itself: nothing is dropped, so TikTok never refetches a batch it already sent. The day rolls over at four in the morning unless you move it, and the count and the hold both survive the app being killed. If a hold arriving out of nowhere is not what you want, there is a switch that fades the feed out over the last three quarters of a minute of a time budget, so you can see it coming. It needs a budget in minutes to follow and a hold to lead into, and it stays out of the way if you have turned system animations off.

Diagnostics includes Back up settings, Restore settings and Reset settings even without the logging patch. Backups include patch preferences and Feature Gate Lab rules with their enabled state. Choose a JSON file through Android's file picker. Invalid files leave settings unchanged. Restore and reset keep one undo copy inside TikTok; export a backup first if you plan to clear app data or reinstall, since that removes the undo copy too. Restart after restoring or resetting.

Backups record which settings they contain, so missing entries are rejected. A backup is a set of values to apply rather than a picture of the whole app, so anything it predates is left as you have it and the restore says how many that was. A backup from before the download destinations were split carries the one folder it knew about, and that fills in all three. If saving fails, recovery attempts both preference stores and keeps the undo copy available.

The Hook status row answers a question the patch list cannot. The patcher knows what it wrote into the APK, not whether a hook then found its anchor once TikTok was running, and TikTok renames things every release. When a hook loses its anchor the switch above it still reads on while nothing happens. Tap the row for a line per surface: how many lookups bound, how many did not, and the first thing that went missing. It speaks for the surfaces that report, which are the comments, the inbox, the share sheet, the feed overlay and the feed models, so "everything found what it needed" means everything it watches rather than all 70 patches. The same table goes into the exported diagnostic report, so it travels with a bug report.

<img src="assets/settings/diagnostics.png" alt="Settings backup, restore, reset and undo controls" width="300" /> <img src="assets/settings/diagnostics-light.png" alt="Diagnostics in light mode" width="300" />

Feature Gate Lab saves its master switch immediately. Its menu can reset overrides while the switch is off, reset all Lab data, or undo the last reset or import. Imported values stay disabled. Changes run in the background and report their result with a notification. The recorder discards an interrupted session before taking the next baseline. The undo copy stores Lab configuration privately; full-reset undo also restores captured observations during the same app run. Other patch preferences are unchanged.

## Building from source

Use JDK 21 or newer and an Android SDK configured through `local.properties`. GitHub Packages needs `GITHUB_ACTOR` and a `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `read:packages` access for the Morphe dependencies.

Run the runtime tests, then build the Morphe patch bundle and metadata:

```bash
./gradlew :extensions:tiktok:test
./gradlew :patches:generatePatchesList
pwsh -File scripts/validate-release-facts.ps1
./gradlew :patches:buildAndroid
```

The bundle is byte reproducible: two builds of the same commit produce the same file and the same SHA-256, so you can rebuild it yourself and check the published checksum against your own. The one field that would otherwise differ, the build timestamp in the bundle manifest, is pinned to the commit being built. Set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` to override it. `patches/build/bundle.sha256` is written from the finished bundle at the end of `buildAndroid`, so it always describes the file beside it.

Run these tasks in this order. The Android build finishes with `verifyBundle`, which checks the patch list and all three DEX payloads against the checksum recorded by the Android build. You can also run `./gradlew :patches:verifyBundle` on its own to re-check the bundle this checkout built. It compares against a checksum only `buildAndroid` writes, so it will not verify a bundle from anywhere else.

Gradle dependency verification is checked in at `gradle/verification-metadata.xml`. It records the reviewed release graph with SHA-256 checksums, so a changed cached artifact fails during dependency resolution. `mavenLocal()` is disabled by default, including the repository the Morphe settings plugin adds. Use `-PallowMavenLocal=true` only while developing a local plugin artifact, and leave it off for release builds. The wrapper distribution checksum in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` matches Gradle's published 9.7.1 binary.

To save offscreen screenshots, run `./gradlew :extensions:tiktok:test -PscreenshotDir=<absolute-directory>`. The suite opens every settings section in dark and light themes, saves a value through the native picker, and exercises Lab search and overrides. A German fixture checks larger text at 360 dp width, and a Spanish one checks the same page at twice the text size on a 320 dp screen.

Worker-backed settings and Feature Gate Lab tests drain their owned executors before asserting, reset per-sandbox state before each case, and keep the region semantics check separate from the API ICU cross-check. These assertions do not depend on screenshot output or polling sleeps.
Lab boundary tests reject malformed persisted scalars without replacing native values, keep imported rules disabled, clear runtime state across master and reset cycles, and hold recorder limits under concurrent calls. Translation batches expire before a visible fallback is retried, while SIM preset matching accepts missing values and keeps unsupported region fallbacks native.

Runtime tests cover feed marker and sound filters using both getter and field model shapes. Empty metadata and unrelated ids remain eligible; matching markers and sound phrases are rejected by their enabled filters.
Shared resource lookup and global-layout ownership cover the feed, inbox and share hooks, with replacement, detach and failed-install fixtures for the host boundaries. A failed install also detaches the prior root before returning. Sticker publication tests keep collision protection on Android 9 and earlier.
Native boundary tests cover structured numeric coercion and overflow, URL scheme refusal, destination roots, media fallback and frame bounds, plus direct navigation, share, LIVE, sound and translation policy shapes. Codec playback and final container behavior remain native-device checks.
Deep feed tests cover all five count ranges through real responses, repeated response caching, late and final follow delivery, cached and offline fallback policy, hard-filter preservation and bounded probe rotation. The content fixtures reject swallowed runtime failures. Account-write challenge fixtures cover the supported follow, like, comment, repost and story routes found in TikTok 46.2.3. Follow tests drive all seven write routes through the refusal notice and verify that retained requests stop growing at the diagnostic limit. Direct and stream results consume their own request IDs; a skipped request can't reuse an earlier one. Diagnostic account pseudonyms use HMAC-SHA-256 with an installation key. Deliberately broken routes and readers must fail their regression tests.
Video overlay traversals reuse their id, visibility and match buffers, so repeated layout passes do not rebuild the container lists. A synthetic 200-pass trace over 80 cells measured 57.68 ms before the change and 56.09 ms after it.
Legacy settings import tests cover complete JSON and older text fragments, rejecting invalid values before any preference changes.
Numeric tokens retain their precision until validation, and literal NUL characters cannot hide trailing data in imports or undo files.

The generated bundle is written to:

```text
patches/build/libs/patches-<version>.mpp
```

Morphe reads `patches-bundle.json` from this repository, downloads the `.mpp` release asset listed there, and loads the patch metadata from that bundle.

After uploading the bundle and a `SHA256SUMS.txt` file to the GitHub release, verify the published asset against the local build:

```bash
pwsh -File scripts/validate-release-facts.ps1 -VerifyPublishedAsset -ArtifactPath patches/build/libs/patches-<version>.mpp
```

The check follows the indexed URL, compares its SHA-256 with the local artifact, checks the matching entry in `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and counts the patches inside the published bundle against the number the index advertises.

That last one needs the Morphe desktop CLI. Set `HUSHFEED_DESKTOP_JAR` to the jar, or put `morphe-desktop-<version>-all.jar` under `HUSHFEED_WORKDIR` or `build/morphe-tools`, and it is found on its own. Without it the check stops rather than passing, because the count is the only part that reads what people actually download. The CLI wants a JDK 21 or newer, which is often not the `java` first on PATH: `HUSHFEED_JAVA` or `JAVA_HOME` says which one to use.

### Adding a language to the settings screen

The English text in the code is the key. Each language is one table under `extensions/tiktok/src/main/l10n/`, with the English on the left and the translation on the right. A language is kept in one of two forms, and the generator reads both. `de.tsv` is tab separated, one entry per line, `#` starting a comment. `in.csv` is the comma form Weblate hosts: a `source,target` header and a row per entry, quoting whatever needs it. Copy either one to `<language code>.tsv` or `<language code>.csv`, translate the right hand column, then run:

```bash
python scripts/gen-l10n.py
./gradlew :extensions:tiktok:test
```

The script writes two generated files, neither of them meant to be edited by hand. `L10nTranslations.java` is what the extension carries with its own code. `en.csv` is the list of source strings, which is the monolingual base a Weblate project points at, so a translator can work in Weblate and the export drops straight into `l10n/` as `<language code>.csv`. The tests fail on any settings text that has no entry, on a language missing one, and on a table whose values are not the ones in the generated class, so both a gap and a stale run of the script show up before anything ships. Name the file with the code Android reports, which for the three languages that have two is the older one: `in` rather than `id`. The generator makes the table answer to both. The translations used to go into TikTok's own resources, but merging a few hundred strings into a table of 74,765 pushed patching past the memory Morphe Manager allows by default.

## Supported target

- App: TikTok, the global package `com.zhiliaoapp.musically`
- Version: [46.2.3](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/tiktok-pte-ltd/tik-tok-including-musical-ly/tiktok-46-2-3-release/tiktok-46-2-3-android-apk-download/), released 28 July 2026
- Build: version code 2024602030, arm64-v8a and armeabi-v7a, nodpi, minSdk 23
- SHA-256 of the APK every patch was verified against: `2fbe277a568e0e820cb51b09bcf0c0d788dc4fb070e66025f12d11cd3ec16936`

### Why you have to fetch that APK yourself

Google Play only ever serves the newest build it thinks your device can run, so the copy on your phone is almost certainly not 46.2.3, and there is no way to ask Play for an older one. Take the APK from [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/tiktok-pte-ltd/tik-tok-including-musical-ly/tiktok-46-2-3-release/tiktok-46-2-3-android-apk-download/), which serves the exact version, then patch that file rather than the installed app.

### Why that version and not a newer one

Every patch here is tied to code TikTok does not name: the classes and methods are renamed on each build, so a patch finds its place by the shape of the code around it. Those shapes move. 46.2.3 is the build all 70 patches have actually been run against, and the compatibility metadata says so. A newer build may well patch, and the patcher will let you try, but a patch whose anchor moved either fails loudly at patch time or, worse, lands somewhere it should not. TikTok is several minor versions ahead already; checking a newer one means running the whole bundle against it and reading which patches failed, which has not been done yet.

Only the global package is declared in the compatibility metadata.

## Project structure

- `patches/`: Kotlin patch definitions, fingerprints and shared patch utilities.
- `extensions/`: Java extension code the patches inject into TikTok, with the Robolectric tests beside it.
- `extensions/tiktok/src/main/l10n/`: the settings translation tables.
- `scripts/`: `gen-l10n.py` generates translations, `verify-all-patches.ps1` checks every patch against a fixture, `measure-patch-heap.ps1` checks selected memory limits, and `validate-release-facts.ps1` checks the public version, patch facts, that the URL in the bundle index answers, and the published bundle hash.
- `patches-list.json`: generated patch metadata.
- `patches-bundle.json`: the Morphe source index for the published bundle.

## Credits

Hushfeed stands on a lot of other people's work, and the licence asks that this stays visible.

- [icysymmetra/tiktok-patches-for-morphe](https://github.com/icysymmetra/tiktok-patches-for-morphe), the Metra patches this project was forked from. Most of the original patch set, the settings framework and the Feature Gate Lab come from there, as does the release history below 0.8.0 in the changelog.
- [ReVanced](https://gitlab.com/revanced/revanced-patches), whose TikTok patches the whole lineage continues, and [RookieEnough/De-Vanced](https://github.com/RookieEnough/De-Vanced), which upstream was built from.
- [hxreborn/hxreborn-tiktok-patches](https://github.com/hxreborn/hxreborn-tiktok-patches) for the inbox injectors, the telemetry patch, the risk control CAPTCHA hook and several feed card filters.
- [BlueDragon4251/tiktok-patches-for-morphe](https://github.com/BlueDragon4251/tiktok-patches-for-morphe) for the seen video filter, the gate recorder and the download quality ideas.

Files that came from another project keep their original notices, and files written here say so in their header.

## Notes

- Hushfeed is not affiliated with TikTok, ByteDance or Morphe. "For Morphe" describes compatibility, nothing more.
- Patching a client TikTok didn't ship is your call. Some accounts see risk control puzzles or find that follows don't land on patched builds. Follow diagnostics says so when it happens, and the CAPTCHA hide never touches a puzzle raised over a follow, like, comment or repost.
- Everything Hushfeed adds runs inside TikTok, as TikTok. It has the permissions TikTok has and can reach the data TikTok can reach, so installing a patched build is the same trust decision as installing any app: you are trusting whoever produced the code. Read it before you run it. That is what the source is for.
- This repository and its [GitHub releases](https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/hushfeed/releases) are the only official source. Anything else offering a Hushfeed build, however similar the name or the site looks, was not made here.
- Bugs and ideas go in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/hushfeed/issues). Include the TikTok version, the patch involved, and what you expected.
