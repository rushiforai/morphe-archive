<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Checks a push before it leaves the machine.

.DESCRIPTION
    This project builds nothing on GitHub, so a push is the last point at which anything can
    be checked. Its only reported failure so far was a source index that advertised a bundle
    the release did not carry, which the release check catches when it is actually run.

    Called by .git/hooks/pre-push with the remote name and URL, reading the pushed refs from
    standard input the way git supplies them. Run scripts/install-hooks.ps1 once to wire it up.

    Only what changed is checked: runtime tests when extension or patch sources move, every patch
    applied to each declared TikTok build when bundle inputs move, and the release facts when a
    published file moves. Set HUSHFEED_SKIP_PRE_PUSH=1 to push anyway.
