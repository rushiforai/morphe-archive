.SYNOPSIS
    Checks a push before it leaves the machine.

.DESCRIPTION
    This project builds nothing on GitHub, so a push is the last point at which anything can
    be checked. Its only reported failure so far was a source index that advertised a bundle
    the release did not carry, which the release check catches when it is actually run.

    Called by .git/hooks/pre-push with the remote name and URL, reading the pushed refs from
    standard input the way git supplies them. Run scripts/install-hooks.ps1 once to wire it up.

    Only what changed is checked: runtime tests when extension or patch sources move, and the
    release facts when a published file moves. Set HUSHFEED_SKIP_PRE_PUSH=1 to push anyway.

# wherever pwsh is off the PATH: a git hook runs with git's environment, so that is the ordinary
# case rather than the rare one.

        Git writes "<local ref> <local sha> <remote ref> <remote sha>" per ref on stdin. A remote
        sha of all zeroes means the branch is new there, so compare against its first parent
        instead of diffing against nothing and checking the entire history.

        Read from the console rather than $input: a script started with -File binds stdin to its
        parameters, so piping into it fails to bind and leaves $input empty, which made the hook
        report that a push changed nothing.
