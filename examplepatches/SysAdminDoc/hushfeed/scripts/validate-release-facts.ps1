.SYNOPSIS
    Check public release facts against the generated patch list.

.DESCRIPTION
    The generated patches-list.json is the local source for the release version, target
    package, target version and patch count. This check makes README.md, patches-bundle.json
    and the recorded runtime test count agree before a release is published. It also checks
    the canonical Morphe add-source link in the README and verifies that its landing page is live. A guarded
    preparation mode lets the source commit reach GitHub while the public index still points
    at the previous working bundle. Published-asset verification remains strict.
