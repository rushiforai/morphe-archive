.SYNOPSIS
    Check that nothing the bundle injects uses a register its host method never declared.

.DESCRIPTION
    A patch that writes into a register beyond the method's register count assembles without
    complaint and applies without complaint. The desktop CLI reports it as applied. It fails
    only when a device verifies the class, and then it fails as a VerifyError on whatever
    screen happens to reach it first.

    Two checks, either of which catches that:

    Static. scripts/DexDiff.java lists every method the patched APK does not share with the
    clean build it came from, and holds each line that was not in the clean body, and every
    line of the bundle's own added methods, to that method's register count.

    On a device. The Android runtime's own verifier is the authority, so with -Serial the
    clean APK and the patched APK are both put through dex2oat with the verify filter and the
    verifier's messages are compared. This target's own code raises lock-verification warnings
    on both, which is why it compares the two tallies rather than looking for an empty one: the
    patched build has to raise the messages the clean build raises, as often, and nothing else.

    Both halves refuse to pass on absent evidence. A run where the clean build raised nothing,
    or the patched build raised nothing, or the dex comparison found no difference at all, is
    a run that compared the wrong things, and it says so instead of reporting success.

    The CLI's own --verify-with-sdk is not used here. Its d8 stage cannot round-trip this
    target's classes14.dex on any installed build-tools version, patched or not, so it reports
    a failure that says nothing about the bundle.
