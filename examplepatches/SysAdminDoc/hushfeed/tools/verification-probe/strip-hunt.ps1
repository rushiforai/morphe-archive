.SYNOPSIS
    Tallies the kinds of strip above a caption and banner under a video the test phone is served.

.DESCRIPTION
    A strip above a caption (a place, an effect, a film, a link to another app) is one of the
    video's anchors, and the bar under a video is one of its banners. TikTok names each kind with
    a component key, and a switch that hides one kind needs that key. Guessing it from TikTok's
    config is no substitute: the config lists over a hundred and fifty of them.

    Each round asks the probe's stripkeys action for the keys of the video in front, then swipes
    to the next one, only while TikTok is in front. Keys are identifiers only, never what a strip
    says. The tally at the end says how often each key came up; an anchor also carries TikTok's
    type number for it.

    The probe reads a video's lists as the app holds them, after Hushfeed's own switches took their
    kinds out, so a banner a switch removes (the search banner under Hide bottom search bar, for
    one) never shows up here. The export's CaptionStrip and BottomBanner lines count every kind
    before any switch acts, so read the probe's report action after a hunt as well.

    With -Shots, the first video of each new key other than a place is screenshotted to
    work/strip-hunt/, so a key can be matched with what its strip showed. The pictures show other
    people's videos, and work/ never goes into git.

.EXAMPLE
    Load the probe (tools/verification-probe/build.ps1, then its instrument line), open the For
    You feed in TikTok, then:

    tools/verification-probe/strip-hunt.ps1 -Rounds 150 -Shots
