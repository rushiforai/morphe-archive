/**
 * Reaches Hushfeed's own settings on a phone, for the device checks in Roadmap_Blocked.md.
 *
 * <p>Hushfeed hangs its settings screen off TikTok's ad personalisation activity, which is not
 * exported, so adb cannot start it and the row that leads to it sits inside TikTok's Settings and
 * privacy. On an account TikTok has asked to answer a content-reuse migration, that page cannot be
 * opened without answering, and that answer is the account owner's to give. This runs inside
 * TikTok's own process instead, where starting the activity and reading or writing a setting are
 * ordinary calls.
 *
 * <h2>Why the work does not happen in onCreate</h2>
 *
 * <p>The obvious shape, do the work in {@link #onCreate} and answer through {@code am instrument
 * -w}, does not run at all on this target. TikTok replaces the thread's Instrumentation with its
 * own: the clean 46.2.3 build reflects on {@code mInstrumentation} in eight places, among them
 * {@code SharedPreferencesManager.hookInstrumentation} and {@code BTMInstrumentationProxy.hook},
 * and its replacement does not pass onCreate on. So nothing after the swap is a reliable entry
 * point, and there is no result bundle to answer with either.
 *
 * <p>{@link #newApplication} is before the swap. The framework calls it while it is building the
 * Application, which is what runs the app's own attachBaseContext, so it is the last callback that
 * is certainly still this class. That starts a thread, the thread waits for Hushfeed to have a
 * context, and then it registers a receiver. Everything after that arrives as a broadcast and is
 * answered in the log, because the instrumentation has no way back to the shell by then.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here is part of the bundle. It is a test tool, it is signed with the same key as the
 * sideloaded build so the platform lets it in, and it should be uninstalled when the checks are
 * done.
