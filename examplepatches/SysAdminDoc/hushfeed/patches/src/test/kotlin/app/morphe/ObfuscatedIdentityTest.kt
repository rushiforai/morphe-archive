/**
 * Every name R8 or aapt2 made up for one TikTok build, written into this repository as though it
 * were the name of something.
 *
 * <p>The ROADMAP's first gate for this was a grep for `LX/xxxx;` class names, and it missed
 * nearly everything of the same kind: method and field names passed as strings (`"LIZ"`,
 * `"LJFF"`), short member names compared by `name ==`, prefixes (`startsWith("LX/")`), merged
 * lambda groups (`LY/...;`) and shortened resource entry names (`o1k`, `a3y`, `kzj`). Each of
 * them is right on 46.2.3 and means something else, or nothing, on the next build, and a patch
 * that applies with one of them in it can do nothing or do the wrong thing without a word.
 *
 * <p>What is here today is recorded in `obfuscated-identities.txt`, one `path|name` per line,
 * so that the list can only shrink: a name that turns up and is not in it fails this test, and
 * so does a line in it that no longer matches anything, so the record stays the truth.
 * Anchoring a patch on what a class is, rather than on what one build called it, is the fix for
 * each line; adding a line is for a name that genuinely has nothing else to go on, and says so
 * in the commit.
