/**
 * Every Kotlin file in the patch tree opens with a notice saying where it came from.
 *
 * <p>The extension module holds the same rule for its Java. CONTRIBUTING requires a
 * `Forked from:` URL on source derived from another project and requires an existing notice to
 * survive a file being modified or moved, and on 2026-09-15 two files in this tree were found to
 * have been imported with a ReVanced notice and to have lost it since. Morphe's DMCA notice took
 * 702 repositories off GitHub over attribution, so it is a gate rather than a paragraph.
 *
 * <p>The wording is not policed, only its presence and its position: a notice below the imports
 * is one a reader opening the file does not see.
