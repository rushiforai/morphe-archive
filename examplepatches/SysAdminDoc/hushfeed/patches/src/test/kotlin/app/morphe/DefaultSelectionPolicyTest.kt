/**
 * Morphe Manager's simple mode picks every patch in the default selection, so that is where a
 * patch belongs unless there is a reason a reader should choose it on purpose.
 *
 * <p>A patch in the default selection has to leave TikTok as it ships until the reader turns a
 * switch on, and including it can't break installing, updating, signing in or the region. The
 * rest are named here with the reason they stay out, so leaving a new patch out of the default
 * is a decision someone wrote down rather than an accident of its declaration.
