/**
 * The startup task that notices the SIM has changed and reports it.
 *
 * <p>Read out of the 46.2.3 fixture on 2026-09-09. `run` is gated on the `enable_sim_utils` AB
 * key, reads `TelephonyManager.getSimState`, builds the current SIM identity through
 * `LX/0Nif;->LIZ`, compares it with the one stored in Keva under `last_sim_info`, stores the new
 * one, and if the two differ reads `SubscriptionManager.getActiveSubscriptionInfoCount` (index 82)
 * and sends the event `ttac_sim_change_detect` carrying `sim_change_type`, `duration`, `n_sim`,
 * `prev_sim_country_code`, `prev_carrier`, `curr_sim_country_code` and `curr_carrier`. That event
 * is all it does: nothing else in the app reads `last_sim_info`, so the task can be skipped
 * whole.
 *
 * <p>"Differ" means the first field of `LX/0Nie;` only, which its own `toString` names
 * `subscriptionId` and which comes from `SubscriptionManager.getDefaultDataSubscriptionId` or
 * `getActiveDataSubscriptionId`. The country and carrier are the second and third fields and take
 * no part in the comparison: they come from `LX/1AbB;->LLIIZ` and `LLILII`, which wrap
 * `TelephonyManager.getSimCountryIso` and `getSimOperatorName`, so the spoof already reaches them
 * and both halves of the event read as the preset. Neither the subscription id nor the
 * subscription count goes through TikTok's telephony wrappers at all, so what the event still
 * carries is the phone's real SIM count and the fact that its hardware changed.
