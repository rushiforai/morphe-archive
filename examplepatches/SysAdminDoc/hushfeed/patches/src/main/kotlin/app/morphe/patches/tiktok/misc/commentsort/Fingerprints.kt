 * match by prefix, so "L" is any object.
 *
 * <p>This is the looser of the two anchors and so the one that could bind quietly: the patcher
 * takes the first match and does not complain about a second. In 46.2.3 exactly two methods carry
 * the string and only one has this shape, so there is nothing to pick between; on a build with
 * more, this would bind to whichever came first rather than fail. The eligibility anchor below
 * refuses a second candidate by name instead.
