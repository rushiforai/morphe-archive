<#
.SYNOPSIS
    The helpers the release and verification scripts share.

.DESCRIPTION
    Dot-source this beside patch-target.ps1 and patch-report.ps1:

        . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'common.ps1')

    Each of these existed in two to four copies that had already drifted apart. The path guard
    was identical in three scripts; the cleanup helper recursed unconditionally in one and only
    on request in another; the version read appeared four times, twice without -LiteralPath; and
    the desktop CLI was looked up by two functions with different search orders, one returning
    $null and one throwing. Copies of a guard drift in the direction of whichever caller was
    edited last, which is the direction nobody checked.

        :patches:jar (:patches:test does) wrote the plain jar back over the finished bundle under
        the same name. v0.43.0 shipped that jar, and on 2026-09-21 it happened again between the
        build and the index push. buildAndroid now ends by copying the finished bundle here, where
        no other task writes, with bundle.sha256 beside it.

        The source files written after the bundle was built, newest first.

        build/libs without it, so a device build made after a patch change and a test run
        patched with the previous hooks (2026-09-23, Swipe-left controls). Counted: the sources of
        the patches module and its submodules (patches/src/main, patches/<submodule>/src/main,
        the compile-only stubs among them, whose constants can be inlined into patch code), the
        sources of every extension module (extensions/<module>/src/main and
        extensions/<module>/<submodule>/src/main), the Gradle files that shape them, and the R8
        rules (*.pro at extensions/ and in each module, extensions/proguard-rules.pro being the
        one every extension's R8 step reads). Build output is never under src/main, so it is not

function Get-BaseApk {

    .SYNOPSIS
        The APK whose manifest and resource table describe an app: the file itself, or the base

    .DESCRIPTION
        Facebook ships as a split bundle (.apkm), not as one APK, and aapt2 and the resource check
        read an APK. The base APK holds the manifest and the app's own resource table; the splits
        hold densities, languages and feature modules. An .apks or .apkm names it base.apk, an
        .xapk names it after the package, so the largest APK is the fallback.

        Both paths are resolved against PowerShell's location before .NET sees them, and the
        answer is a full path. .NET reads a relative path against the process's own directory,
        which a hook, a scheduled task or a session that moved with Set-Location leaves somewhere
        else: `-Apk fixtures\facebook.apkm` then named a file that wasn't there.

function Find-MachineNames {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        The lines of tracked files that name the maintainer's machine or a phone.
    .DESCRIPTION
        The working-notes folder .gitignore keeps out, the backup folders on the maintainer's
        machine that share its name, and an adb serial, a Samsung one being R5C and eight more
        letters or digits. Four fixture tests once fell back to one of those folders, which
        skipped quietly on every other machine and published this one's layout, and five scripts
        carried the test phone's serial. .gitignore is the one file allowed to name what it keeps
        out. Both patterns are built from parts, so the file holding them can't match itself.

        git grep reads bytes, so text in UTF-16 has patterns of its own: every letter followed by a
        NUL for little-endian, the way Windows PowerShell's > writes a file, or preceded by one for
        big-endian. They go through git grep's Perl regexes, which read \x00. A git built without
        them can't search, which throws like any search that doesn't run.

        With -Commit the files are read out of those commits, which is what a push publishes, and
        no worktree is needed: git grep reads them all in one pass and puts the commit in front of
        each hit, <commit>:<path>:<line>:<text>. Without it, the tracked files as they stand in the
        working tree. GIT_* variables are cleared for the search, so it reads the repository -Root
        names, and a search that doesn't run throws rather than reading as a clean tree. Every hit
        comes back as git grep prints it; none at all comes back as nothing, so callers wrap it in @().
