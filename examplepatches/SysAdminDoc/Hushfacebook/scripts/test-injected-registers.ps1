.SYNOPSIS
    Exercise DexDiff.java against dex files that break one check each.

.DESCRIPTION
    BadDexFixture.java writes a clean host, a patched build of it that passes every check, and one
    patched build per check that breaks that check and nothing else: a branch into an instruction,
    a branch to itself, a switch case into an instruction, a switch pointed at the other kind of
    table, a branch or switch case onto a payload (a packed or sparse switch's, or
    fill-array-data's) or a move-result, flow that falls into a payload, starts at one or runs off
    the end of the code, an invoke with too few registers, a wide argument split across two
    registers, the static off-by-one, the upper half of a wide parameter read as an object, a
    narrow constant read as a long and the reverse (the AMOLED sweep's bug on 580), either half of
    a live long overwritten and the other half still read, a broken pair or a narrow constant on
    one arm of a branch or on a loop's back edge, either half of a pair broken on one arm moved
    where the arms meet, a zero on one arm read as a long, a conflict (an object on one arm, an
    int on the other) read by each instruction and in each register that takes a value, or read
    through a copy, a wide move of a conflict, a long and a lone upper half tested against zero,
    an int and an object tested for equality in either order, a move-result the patch separated
    from its invoke, bad try ranges and handlers (a handler at a switch or array payload among
    them), a move-exception the method's entry reaches, the one feed guard doubled, moved or
    missing, the reels hook deleted from the pre-EOF injector or put after a branch, the showcase
    stub left unfilled, calling another class, or calling a class that isn't the only one
    answering its type name, Clean up Reels' hook deleted from Facebook's Follow check or put
    after a branch there, Use the phone's emoji's hooks deleted from Facebook's emoji typeface
    provider and from its maker of emoji picture addresses, or put after a branch there, Open
    Messenger from the top bar's hooks deleted from the Messenger icon's tap and from its button
    handler, or put after a branch there, Turn off double tap to like's hooks deleted from the reel
    like helper's like and from the feed attachment's onDoubleTap, or put after a branch there, Keep
    the reel speed's hook deleted from the Reels menu's speed toast, or put after a branch there, and
    the GenAI reel stub left unfilled, filled with a call that stays in the extension, or calling
    Facebook's finder only after it has returned. Each start-call hook is also put first in a method
    holding part of what its rule picks by (the tray controller, onPause, another method naming both
    surfaces, a method holding the emoji provider's log tag alone, an instance method holding the
    emoji pictures' base address, a method of the tap's shape holding one entry point, a method of
    another shape holding "long_press", a static method holding the like's trace, a static method
    holding "translationY", an instance method holding the toast's selector name), and one rule is
    given two methods to choose from; all eleven fail naming the method the rule picks. The Follow hook is also put first in that other method as
    well as in the check. A register out of range fails as its own finding:
    named by a helper added to a host class, as the upper half of a long read from the last
    register, as a long an extension method writes there, and in the feed guard. Each of the five
    ShortcutManager calls the settings patch sends to the
    extension is left in Facebook's code by a build of its own, which has to fail that call's no-call
    rule and no other, and the contract file may hold no no-call rule without such a build. The
    call that gives the Facebook logo its touch listener is left as Facebook makes it, the stand-in
    is sent in place of the container's call instead, made on the container's register, sent
    twice, sent in another top bar method holding the logo's first trace section with the builder
    left alone, or sent there as well as in the builder, and a second builder answers the rule, a
    build each, and each has to fail the logo's next-call rule for its own reason; the contract
    file may hold no other next-call rule. The call that hands the Reels viewer's batch of watched
    reels to its executor is left as Facebook makes it, the watch-history stand-in is sent in
    another batcher method holding the mutation's name with the flush left alone, sent there as
    well as in the flush, sent twice, sent with Facebook's call left beside it, or handed the two
    registers the wrong way round, and a second flush answers the rule, a build each, each failing
    the sole-call rule for its own reason; a clean build whose flush makes no such call fails the
    good build's stand-in for want of one to stand in for, and the contract file may hold no other
    sole-call rule. The feed guard's call in the runnable that swaps an edge into the feed is left
    out, sent to another method of the runnable holding the first size of its log line with run()
    left alone, sent there as well as in run(), sent twice, and a second run() answers the rule, a
    build each, each failing the once-call rule for its own reason; the contract file may hold no
    other once-call rule.
    The good build carries the joins, copies and reads ART accepts, a zero tested against
    an object among them, so a check made stricter still has to pass them. Each bad build has to
    fail with findings of its own category only, so a check that fires for the wrong reason fails
    here too. Removed methods and DEX entries, the removal allowlist, and the device tally
    comparison are held to what they did before.
    verify-injected-registers.ps1 also runs end to end with stand-in tools, and its wiring is read
    through the parser (script-wiring.ps1), with the wiring checks themselves tried on copies that
    drop the calls but keep their text, at least one for each rule of what a script can't reach.
