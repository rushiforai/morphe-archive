/**
 * Names every method a patched APK does not share with the clean one it was built from, and prints
 * the register evidence for each: how many registers the method declares, and every instruction the
 * two bodies do not have in common.
 *
 * <p>The point of it is the last line of the report. A patch that writes into a register the method
 * never declared assembles happily and only fails when a device verifies the class, so every
 * instruction that was not in the clean body is checked against the register count of the method it
 * landed in. Methods the patch adds outright, which is where a hand-written bridge lives and where
 * the registers are chosen rather than inherited, are checked the same way: every one of them, the
 * helpers a patch adds to one of Facebook's own classes as well as the extension's. Every
 * instruction of every changed and added method is also held to its method's count in the structural
 * pass, the upper half of each wide value it reads or writes included, and one out of range is a
 * finding there rather than a register the later checks step over.
 *
 * <p>Three things this deliberately does not leave to chance:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A wide instruction names one register and occupies two, so a destination that sets a wide
 *       register counts as reaching one higher than it names. Missing that would let a
 *       {@code const-wide} one short of the ceiling read as safe.
 *   <li>The highest register travels with the rendered line rather than being read back out of the
 *       text, because this app has string constants that look like register names ({@code v4190},
 *       {@code v20200906}) and parsing the text flags five of them.
 *   <li>Absence of evidence is a failure, not a pass. A run that finds no changed methods, or no
 *       added methods of the extension's own, is comparing the wrong pair of files and says so
 *       instead of reporting nothing wrong.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Branch targets and try-block ranges are part of a body's identity here, so a change that only
 * moves a jump or widens an exception range still shows up as a changed method.
 *
 * <p>Every changed and added method is also held to the structural rules Facebook's own crash
 * reports came from (FroggoMorphePatches issues 3, 16 and 21): a branch or switch case that lands
 * inside an instruction ("target dex pc is not at instruction start"), an invoke whose registers
 * don't match what the callee takes, a parameter register read as the wrong kind (the static and
 * wide off-by-one), a register the body wrote at the wrong width (a narrow const left where a
 * const-wide was, which the AMOLED sweep did on 580), a move-result cut off from its invoke, and a
 * try range or handler off an instruction boundary. A contract file adds
 * rules about the whole APK: the feed filter's guard has exactly one call site, in
 * addNewEdgeToCollection, because two guards stacked on that method is what broke Froggo's
 * builds; and each extension stub a patch fills in with one of Facebook's renamed accessors calls
 * it before it returns, so a patch that stopped filling one fails here instead of shipping a stub
 * that answers its marker forever; and the Stories tray hook comes first in each of the two tray
 * adapter methods, and the reels hook first in the pre-EOF injector; and the settings patch's
 * stand-in for the Facebook logo's touch listener comes right after the logo gets its tap, on the
 * same view; and the reel watch-history hook takes the place of the one call in the batcher's flush
 * that hands its batch to an executor, on that call's registers; and the runnable that swaps an
 * edge into the feed asks the extension about it once. A start-call, next-call, sole-call or
 * once-call rule names its method by the strings it loads, and a shape where strings alone don't
 * tell it apart, and exactly one of Facebook's methods may answer that: five hold
 * "FeedRefreshTriggerController" on 580, so a rule naming that string alone passed a hook in any
 * of them, and the logo rule named one string and counted calls in any method holding it. The
 * device verifier stays the authority; these catch the known shapes without a phone.

     *       site, there.
     *   <li>"first-call &lt;method reference&gt; on &lt;class&gt;": the method calls a method of
     *       &lt;class&gt; that takes no arguments before its first return or throw. A stub the
     *       patch filled does; one still answering its marker doesn't.
     *   <li>"first-call &lt;method reference&gt; on-type-named &lt;GraphQL type&gt;": the same, where
     *       the class is the one whose {@code getTypeName()} answers &lt;GraphQL type&gt; as a
     *       literal. For an accessor on a class Redex renames, which no contract can name, and
     *       exactly one class may answer the type.
     *   <li>"first-call &lt;method reference&gt; outside &lt;class prefix&gt;": the method calls a
     *       method of a class whose type doesn't start with &lt;class prefix&gt;, whatever it takes,
     *       before its first return or throw. For a stub the patch fills with a call to a method it
     *       found by what the method does, whose class is a Redex name and no model answering a type
     *       name. A stub still answering its marker makes no call, and one whose only call stays in
     *       the extension doesn't leave it.
     *   <li>"start-call &lt;method reference&gt; [in [static|instance] &lt;shape&gt;] holding
     *       &lt;string&gt; [&lt;string&gt; ...]": exactly one method outside the bundle's own code
     *       loads every one of the strings and has the shape, a descriptor such as
     *       {@code (Lcom/facebook/auth/usersession/FbUserSession;*)Z} where * stands for any run of
     *       characters. That method calls the method reference, with nothing before the call but
     *       plain instructions (no other call, branch, switch, return or throw), and no other
     *       method loading the strings calls it.
     *   <li>"no-call &lt;method reference&gt; outside &lt;class prefix&gt;": no class but those whose
     *       type starts with &lt;class prefix&gt; calls it. For a call the patch sends to the
     *       extension everywhere, where the extension makes the real one and a call left anywhere
     *       else would undo what the patch is for.
     *   <li>"next-call &lt;method reference&gt; after &lt;method reference&gt; [in [static|instance]
     *       &lt;shape&gt;] holding &lt;string&gt; [&lt;string&gt; ...]": exactly one method outside the
     *       bundle's own code loads every one of the strings and has the shape, as for start-call.
     *       That method calls the first method once, no other host method calls it, and the
     *       instruction just before the call calls the second method, on the same first register.
     *       For a hook sent in place of one call of a known pair, so it can't drift onto another
     *       view, another call or another method holding the same strings.
     *   <li>"sole-call &lt;method reference&gt; replacing &lt;method reference&gt; [in [static|instance]
     *       &lt;shape&gt;] holding &lt;string&gt; [&lt;string&gt; ...]": exactly one method outside the
     *       bundle's own code loads every one of the strings and has the shape. It calls the first
     *       method once and the second not at all, no other host method calls the first, and that
     *       call reads the registers, in their order, that the clean build's one call to the
     *       second method there read. For a hook that takes one call's place: left out or left
     *       beside the call it stands in for, the call it replaces still happens, and on other
     *       registers the hook gets the wrong values.
     *   <li>"once-call &lt;method reference&gt; [in [static|instance] &lt;shape&gt;] holding &lt;string&gt;
     *       [&lt;string&gt; ...]": exactly one method outside the bundle's own code loads every one of
     *       the strings and has the shape, as for start-call. That method calls the method reference
     *       once, anywhere in its body, and no other host method calls it. For a hook that has to
     *       read what the method made first, so it can't come first, and follows no one call.
