/**
 * A return after all Facebook UI was hidden, and the one answer every feed refresh check of that
 * return gets.
 *
 * <p>Facebook checks more than once as it comes back: FeedRefreshTriggerController's resume
 * callback, the feed's warm-start check, which NewsFeedFragment's onResume reaches and which
 * refreshes a feed left alone for a few minutes, and NewsFeedFragment's foreground auto-scroll. The
 * first check after the UI was hidden decides, and every check within {@link #SAME_RETURN_MS} of it
 * gets the same answer. Later checks of those three are Facebook's own.
 *
 * <p>Inside the app, a tab switch back to Home or the feed back from another screen reaches four
 * more: the feed's hot-start check, its stale-post executor (from the visibility change, and from
 * the worker it posts on pause), NewsFeedTabDataFetch's AUTO_REFRESH and, on accounts with the
 * friendly feed, the HOT_LOAD NewsFeedFragment's onTabEntered starts once Home has been left long
 * enough. Those keep the feed while the switch is on, and never use a return up
 * ({@link #decideInApp}). The hot-start check keeps it through the warm-start check it asks, past
 * that check's empty-feed load, so an empty feed loads.
 *
 * <p>While Facebook is away it also tears the feed's stories down once it has been gone as long as
 * the warm-start threshold, and a torn-down feed loads new posts on the return whatever the checks
 * say. With the switch on that teardown is skipped: see {@link #keepFeedWhileAway()}.
