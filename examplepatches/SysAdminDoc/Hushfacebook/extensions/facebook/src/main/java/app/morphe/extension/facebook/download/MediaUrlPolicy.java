/**
 * Which addresses a save may fetch.
 *
 * <p>The address comes out of Facebook's own objects by reflection, and the story path ranks
 * whatever text it finds there. Something that can put text into one of those objects could
 * otherwise send this process to any host it likes, a router's admin page or a service on the
 * phone itself included. So every address, the first and each redirect, has to be HTTPS on the
 * default port, with no user name in it, to a host of Meta's media CDNs.
 *
 * <p>The host check is the one that matters: TLS then has to show Meta's certificate for that
 * name, which nothing on a home network can. When the socket goes straight to the address the
 * phone's own lookup gives, that answer has to be public too, a second fence against a lookup
 * that points a Meta name at a private address. It is advisory: the connection looks the name up
 * again, so a resolver that changes its answer between the two gets past it to a handshake, and
 * TLS is what stops it there. The lookup uses the host exactly as the connection does, trailing
 * dot and all, so the two at least read one cache entry. Through a VPN or a proxy the lookup
 * isn't where the socket goes, so that fence stays down there, and a proxy resolves the name
 * itself.
 *
 * <p>FAKE_IP: fake-IP DNS (Clash, mihomo, sing-box, v2rayNG, OpenClash, common where Facebook
 * is blocked) answers every name from 198.18.0.0/15, fc00::/18 or fdfe:dcba:9876::/64 and
 * carries the connection to the real host. It runs as a VPN on the phone, which the route sees, or on the home router, which it
 * can't: a direct route then gets those answers too, and refusing them failed every save there.
 * Neither range is a home network's, so they are let through on every route.
 *
 * <p>No Android type here, like {@link RenditionPicker}: the rules run under plain JUnit. Not final,
 * so a test can let its local server through and hand every other hop to these rules.
