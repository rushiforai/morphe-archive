/**
 * What the Clean up Reels patch asks before a reel's footer is built.
 *
 * <p>Three switches, five hooks, all in the Reels viewer of Facebook 577 and 580:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The chips under a reel come from one method that walks the reel's attribution models and
 *       builds the list of those it will draw. The patch hands that list here before each return,
 *       and {@link #filterChips} answers the chips to keep, or null to keep the list as it came.
 *       Each chip is a generated model that answers its GraphQL type with {@code getTypeName()},
 *       and only the types in {@link #HIDDEN_CHIPS} go. A type this doesn't know stays.
 *   <li>The Follow button beside a reel's author is built only when Facebook's Follow check
 *       answers yes, and {@link #hideFollowButton} is asked first thing in that check. The author
 *       row asks it on every surface, the Reels tab included. So do the author rows of sponsored
 *       reels and the feed, about a reel attached to a post.
 *   <li>An author you already follow gets a Following button there instead, which Facebook's own
 *       config getter for removing it takes away when it answers true. {@link #hideFollowingButton}
 *       is asked first thing in that getter. The row reads the getter only for such an author,
 *       which is why it alone left the Follow button on everyone else's reels.
 *   <li>The comment Facebook picks to show under a reel and the bubbles of friends who reacted each
 *       come from a query a runnable starts. {@link #skipHotComment} and {@link #skipSocialBubbles}
 *       are asked first thing in each, and true makes the runnable return before it queries.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Every hook fails open: until the settings are ready, while Hushfacebook is paused, with a
 * switch off, or when something throws, Facebook's own path runs.
