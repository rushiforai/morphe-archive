/**
 * Facebook's own answer to whether its dark mode is on, for the whole app.
 *
 * <p>Both themes change Facebook's dark mode only, and a colour can't always say which mode is on.
 * The Video tab stays dark in light mode: its themed context is built from FDS's dark style, and its
 * bottom bar reads the same colour resource as dark mode's, so the same #252728 reaches the themes
 * in both modes. The patch sends each answer of Facebook's dark mode controller (its Dark mode
 * setting, or the system's night mode when that setting follows the system) through
 * {@link #answer}, which keeps the latest. Facebook asks it as each activity applies its theme, again
 * after the setting or the system's night mode changes, and before it builds the Video tab's themed
 * context, so the kept answer follows the setting. Reading it is one volatile read, which suits the
 * colour hooks that run on every layout pass.
 *
 * <p>Facebook makes a controller per user session, and each activity asks the one of its own
 * session, but one answer does for the app: every signed-in session's controller reads the same
 * app-level setting, and only the logged-out session's follows the phone instead, while nothing but
 * logged-out screens are up (DarkModeSettingFixtureTest). The answer comes from any thread that asks,
 * a feed request or an app job as well as the UI, so a change is one atomic swap.
 *
 * <p>Until Facebook first answers, {@link #on} says dark, so the themes act as they did before there
 * was an answer to ask. {@link #saidOn} waits for the answer, for the colours that are the same in
 * both of Facebook's themes and so can't say for themselves which one is on.
