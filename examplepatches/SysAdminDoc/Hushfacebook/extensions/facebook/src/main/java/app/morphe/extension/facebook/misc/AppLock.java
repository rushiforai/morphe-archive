/**
 * Lock Facebook: with its switch on, a cold start and a return after the chosen time cover every
 * Facebook screen and ask for the phone's own screen lock, its fingerprint, face, PIN, pattern or
 * password, through Android's BiometricPrompt. Only a check that passes takes the cover away. One
 * that fails or is cancelled leaves Facebook covered, with an Unlock button to ask again, and Back
 * sends Facebook to the background.
 *
 * <p>Facebook carries an app lock of its own, {@code AuthAppLockState}, but in 577, 580 and 581
 * nothing outside its own class reads the "lock due" flag its start sets, and its other readers
 * only keep the screen out of the recent apps view, log, or filter a promotion. There's no lock
 * screen behind it to turn on, so this is the extension's own.
 *
 * <p>Its own activity callbacks drive it ({@link #watch}), registered in every one of Facebook's
 * processes: Instant Games, the Audience Network ads and Facebook's crash screen run in processes
 * of their own, and each process locks on its own cold start and its own time away.
 *
 * <p>Facebook is in front while one of its screens is started and isn't a picture-in-picture
 * window. "Away" starts when the last of those stops, or shrinks into a picture-in-picture window,
 * which Android reports as a pause with the screen already in that mode. The floating window keeps
 * playing and is never covered, but the first full-screen Facebook screen after the chosen time
 * asks, the video brought back to full screen included. A reply typed into a notification runs
 * without any screen, so it starts nothing. A rotation, or a screen Facebook rebuilds for a new
 * configuration, isn't a leave. While the switch is on, Android 13 and later keep Facebook's
 * screens out of the recent apps view, as Facebook's own lock does.
 *
 * <p>Off, settings that aren't ready yet, or a phone without a screen lock, and nothing is covered
 * or asked. Turning the switch on doesn't lock the screen in front. A pause doesn't turn it off,
 * whatever paused Hushfacebook: the Pause switch, the marker file, or safe mode after crashed
 * starts. Each of those is in reach of someone holding the phone, and the switch, which sits
 * behind the lock, is the way off ({@link Settings#APP_LOCK} keeps its value while paused).
 *
 * <p>Only the main process writes the settings file, and a setting holds the value its process
 * loaded at start. So Facebook's other processes, such as its games and ad screens, read the switch
 * and the time away fresh from the file at each check ({@link #lockOn}, {@link #lockAfter}), and a
 * change reaches a game that was already running. They read the XML themselves rather than through
 * SharedPreferences ({@link #readSettingsFile}), whose first load can delete a file the main process
 * is writing. No side process opens the settings file as SharedPreferences at all: the settings
 * class reads it through {@link ReadOnlyPreferences} there, which changes nothing on disk.
 *
 * <p>The main process also leaves a private note in the app's no-backup folder with the boot and
 * the last moment Facebook was unlocked and in use ({@link #shareUnlock}). A side process starting
 * within Lock after of it, on the same boot, doesn't ask again; locking Facebook takes the note away,
 * and a side process only reads it.
 *
 * <p>While locked, the screen's windows are read from the framework's list ({@link #sweep}). One
 * that lands above the cover, focusable or not, stops taking touches and the cover goes back on top.
