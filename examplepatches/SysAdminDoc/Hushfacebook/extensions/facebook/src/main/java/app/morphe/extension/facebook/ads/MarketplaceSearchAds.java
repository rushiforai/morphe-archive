/**
 * What Hide sponsored Marketplace listings takes out of Marketplace search's answers, on their way
 * from Facebook's servers to the React Native screen that draws them.
 *
 * <p>Marketplace search is React Native. Its results reach Relay as the text of a GraphQL answer, in
 * the pieces Tigon reads it in, and nothing in Java holds them as a list. Its query names no variable
 * that asks the server to leave the ads out either, so the ads come out of that text before
 * JavaScript sees it.
 *
 * <p>An answer is one or more JSON payloads, one after another. The first holds the results as a
 * connection's edges. When Relay streams a list, each later result comes in a payload of its own
 * whose path ends at its index in that list, and fields Relay defers come in payloads whose path runs
 * through the result they belong to. A result is an ad when its node is a story of an ad type
 * ({@code __typename} ending "AdStory", as MarketplaceFeedAdStory does) or carries a
 * {@code sponsored_data} object naming an ad id, on the node itself or one object down. An ad's edge
 * leaves its list, a streamed ad's payload gives way to one with no data that keeps its extensions
 * (Relay passes over it but still reads is_final), and every later index of that list moves down
 * past the ads taken out, so the list stays contiguous and no tile is left empty. Deferred fields of
 * an ad go to an index no list reaches, where Relay never applies them.
 *
 * <p>Only a whole payload can be read, so the start of one that hasn't finished arriving waits for
 * the rest, and what still waits when the answer ends goes on as it came. Text between payloads goes
 * straight on, and so does every byte of a payload outside the ads taken out and the indices moved.
 * A payload whose reading fails, or that grows too long to wait for, goes on as it came, and nothing
 * more is taken out of that answer; later indices still move past the ads already taken out, so the
 * list keeps no hole.
