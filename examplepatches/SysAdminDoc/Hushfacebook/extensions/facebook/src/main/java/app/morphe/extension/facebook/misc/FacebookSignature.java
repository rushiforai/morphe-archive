/**
 * Helper for the Facebook "[Fix] Restore screens on re-signed builds" patch.
 *
 * <p>Facebook's security code compares the signing certificate of a package with a table of Meta
 * certificates, and it does this for its own package too. A re-signed build has a different
 * certificate, so Facebook does not trust itself and drops a tap on some screens without a message.
 * The patch gives the check the original certificate of Facebook when the package is this app.
 *
 * <p>The name alone doesn't say that. Morphe's Clone app patch renames the package, and the stock
 * Facebook it was cloned from can stay installed beside it (#16). The uid does: Android gives every
 * installed app its own (Facebook's manifest shares it with no other), and the process has it before
 * any code runs, so the check needs no context even while content providers start.
 *
 * <p>The same reader gives Facebook a caller's signers when it builds the caller's identity for a
 * guarded component. On a re-signed build a Meta family app the user patched with the same key is
 * answered Meta's certificate here too, so Facebook's caller rules judge it exactly as the Meta-signed
 * app. {@link FamilySignatureTrust} makes that decision, and does it whenever this patch runs: the
 * security boundary is the same-key check this reader already carries, so a same-key Messenger,
 * Messenger Lite or Facebook Lite gets it whether or not Install beside Meta's apps is picked too.
