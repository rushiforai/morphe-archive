/**
 * What Open on a chosen tab does when Facebook's main screen is created: it asks Facebook to open
 * on the tab chosen in the settings, the same way Facebook's own tab shortcuts and notifications
 * ask for one.
 *
 * <p>Facebook picks the tab its main screen opens on from the intent that started it. A shortcut or
 * a notification meant for a tab carries the tab's id as {@link FacebookTabs#TARGET_TAB_ID}, and
 * Facebook opens that tab when its tab bar has it and its first tab, Home, when it doesn't. A
 * start from the launcher icon carries nothing, so Facebook opens where it chooses, usually Home.
 * The patch calls {@link #onActivityCreate} first thing in every Facebook activity's
 * {@code onCreate}. When that's the main screen started from the launcher icon, the screen gets a
 * copy of its intent with the chosen tab's id in it, before any of Facebook's own start code reads
 * it. The intent it was started with isn't touched, since Facebook's start-up prediction can be
 * reading it on another thread; all that prediction decides is what to fetch early. While
 * {@link MarketplaceOnly} is on, the tab is Marketplace, whatever the chosen tab and its switch, and
 * a chosen Reels tab that {@link ReelsTab} keeps off the bar is asked for as Home.
 *
 * <p>On a cold start Facebook's own start-up would still drop the request twice. It replaces the
 * intent of a start another app sent, a launcher included, with a copy that keeps no tab, and its
 * tab bar only uses the tab a start asked for when one of Facebook's server-side settings says so.
 * Three hooks in that start-up ask this class while the screen it asked a tab for is being built:
 * {@link #setSanitizedIntent} puts the tab back in Facebook's copy, and {@link #startOnAskedTab} and
 * {@link #keepAskedStartTab} answer yes where Facebook asks whether to use it. Outside that window
 * they pass Facebook's own intent and answers through. On a cold start Facebook builds the screen
 * behind a splash, after Android has already created and resumed it, so the window lasts until the
 * screen is built rather than until it first shows.
 *
 * <p>Everything else keeps its own destination: a link, a notification, a shortcut or anything else
 * that carries one of Facebook's routes, and a screen restored after Android put it away. Nothing
 * here acts once Facebook has built the main screen, so tapping another tab, leaving Facebook and
 * coming back all stay as they were. It fails open: with the switch off, Hushfacebook paused, the
 * settings not ready yet, or a failure in here, the start is Facebook's own.
 *
 * <p>With Debug logging on it logs the start it saw and the tab it asked for, one line per start
 * from each start-up hook, and a moment after the screen first shows and is built, the tab
 * Facebook opened and the tabs in its tab bar, read through names Facebook keeps. A tab this
 * account's tab bar hasn't got is logged too, as Facebook opening Home.
