/**
 * Asks GitHub whether a newer Hushfacebook release is out, once the person has turned that on.
 *
 * <p>A sideloaded Facebook gets no update check, and Morphe Manager looks at its sources only when
 * it's opened, so a new release reached nobody who didn't go looking. This is the only request the
 * extension makes for itself, so it's off until the person turns on
 * {@link Settings#CHECK_FOR_RELEASES}. Then it runs at most once a day, on a worker, when Facebook
 * starts, and the Check now row runs one whenever it's tapped. Paused, or in safe mode, the switch
 * answers off like every other one, and a start asks nothing.
 *
 * <p>The request is one GET of the latest release, over HTTPS to api.github.com and nowhere else:
 * no user name in the address, short timeouts, a cap on the answer, no cookie, and a plain
 * User-Agent naming Hushfacebook and its version. A redirect is followed only while it stays on
 * that host. Of the answer, only the release's version and the Facebook build its notes say it
 * targets are kept. The time of each try is kept before the request goes out, so one that fails,
 * or a Facebook closed in the middle of one, waits its day like any other instead of trying again
 * at every start.
 *
 * <p>What comes back only ever becomes a line on the settings screen. There's no notification,
 * nothing is downloaded and nothing is installed.
