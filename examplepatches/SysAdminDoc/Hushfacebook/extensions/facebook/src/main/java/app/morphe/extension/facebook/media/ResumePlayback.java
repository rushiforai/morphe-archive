/**
 * Resume long videos: a video longer than {@link #MIN_DURATION_MS} that was left partway picks up
 * where it was left, once, the next time a player starts it.
 *
 * <p>Everything here goes through FbGrootPlayer, the player nearly every Facebook surface plays
 * video with, on 577 and 580. The patch tells this class about five moments of it:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #started}, first thing in its kept-name maybeTrackVideoStart, which a start of the
 *       video runs once the video is playing. The first start of a video in a player looks up the
 *       point saved for it and, when there is one, seeks there right after Facebook's start is
 *       done.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #stopped}, first thing in its kept-name maybeTrackVideoStop, which a pause and the
 *       end of the video run. That saves where the video is, or forgets its point at the end.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #released} where the player is released and {@link #rebound} where it's given a
 *       video, which save the same way and start the player over.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #seeking}, first thing in its seek, so a seek someone else makes before the resume
 *       (your drag of the seek bar, or Facebook carrying a position over from the feed) wins.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A point is saved only for a video of at least {@link #MIN_DURATION_MS} that was stopped at
 * least {@link #MIN_SAVED_MS} in and more than {@link #END_MARGIN_MS} before its end. A stop
 * closer to the end forgets the point. Reels, live videos, ads, looping and audio-only players
 * and GIFs are left alone, and so is a start Facebook gives a start point of its own, which is what
 * a link to a moment in a video does. The points are kept in {@link ResumePoints}.
 *
 * <p>Off, paused, before the settings are ready, or when anything here throws, the player plays as
 * Facebook starts it: nothing is saved, nothing is looked up and nothing seeks. The report counts
 * what happened by kind, and Debug logging writes positions and durations, never which video.
