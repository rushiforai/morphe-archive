/**
 * What the Don't send reel watch history patch asks before Facebook sends the reels you watched.
 *
 * <p>Facebook's Reels viewer queues the id of every reel you watch and sends the queue in batches
 * as one GraphQL mutation, FbShortsSeenStateMutation, whose input is those ids and nothing else. It
 * names no viewer and nobody else ever sees it: it's the record Facebook ranks your Reels feed with.
 * The batcher empties its queue, builds the mutation and hands a runnable to an executor, and that
 * runnable is what gives the request to Facebook's GraphQL layer. The patch puts {@link #send} in
 * place of that hand-over, so a batch held back here has already left the queue and isn't kept
 * for a later send. The switch is read when a batch goes out, so reels queued before it's turned
 * off go out with the next batch.
 *
 * <p>It fails open. The runnable is recognised by the name Redex keeps on its class, and anything
 * else goes to the executor as Facebook handed it over: a runnable this doesn't recognise, the
 * switch off, a pause, settings that aren't ready yet, or a failure in here.
