/**
 * Picture-in-picture for reels, through the picture-in-picture Facebook already ships for its
 * Reels viewer (ReelsPipUtil) behind server flags. The viewer first asks a gate of its own whether
 * its surface has picture-in-picture, then ReelsPipUtil whether the activity may use it: Android 12
 * or later, its flags or a preference of its own, the phone's picture-in-picture feature and a
 * memory check. With the switch on, the gate says yes on Android 12 or later, and the check says
 * yes there whenever the phone has the feature. Facebook's own code does the rest: it sets the
 * window's aspect ratio and turns on Android's auto-enter, so a playing reel shrinks into a window
 * when you leave Facebook.
 *
 * <p>Facebook arms the window once as the Reels viewer opens, for that one player: it keeps that
 * player going in the window and turns auto-enter off and on as it pauses and plays. A swipe starts
 * the next reel's player without arming again, so the window would open on a frozen reel, or not at
 * all once the first one's pause turned auto-enter off. So when another reel starts, the extension
 * arms the window again with Facebook's own arguments for that reel's player. And while the window
 * is armed, it sets Facebook's change of auto-enter aside and decides from the reel on screen:
 * while it's paused, auto-enter is off, set the way Facebook's own disarm sets it, and when a reel
 * plays, it's back on.
 *
 * <p>In the window, Facebook's viewer opens in a container with a new view id, which a React
 * Native view on the main screen can already hold. The extension swaps such an id for a free one,
 * or the viewer opens hidden and the window stays black.
 *
 * <p>Off, paused, before the settings are ready, or when anything here fails, the answer is
 * Facebook's own.
