/**
 * Export settings and Import settings.
 *
 * <p>Both open Android's file picker from the settings page. The picker is an activity of its
 * own, so Android may rebuild Facebook's activity behind it, and the settings dialog and its page
 * with it. The result still reaches the page: Android hands it to the fragment the request came
 * from by the name the framework gave it, and a rebuilt page is given the same one. So nothing
 * about a request is kept on the page. Its code says which it was, and the file's address comes
 * with the result.
 *
 * <p>An import reads the file first and shows how many switches it changes. Nothing is written
 * until the person says so, and then everything is written in one commit. The preview is kept in
 * the page's saved state, so a rotation or a trip away from Facebook brings it back.
 *
 * <p>The app holding a file opens, reads and writes it on a worker. The screen waits for it
 * {@link #timeoutMs} at most, then gives the rows back, cancels the open and closes the file.
 * Whatever that app does afterwards shows nothing and changes nothing. An export is read back, so
 * a file that won't import isn't called saved.
