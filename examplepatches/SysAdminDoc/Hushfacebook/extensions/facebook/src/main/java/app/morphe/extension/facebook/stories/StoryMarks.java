/**
 * The story cards you tapped Mark as seen on while viewing anonymously, and what became of each.
 *
 * <p>A card is known by the id Facebook's seen helper queues for it, the same string the report of
 * viewed stories lists in story_ids_list. Everything here belongs to the account it happened on,
 * by the session's user ID: a mark made on one account is never sent for another, and with no
 * account nothing is marked, kept or sent.
 *
 * <p>When a batch of card ids goes to be sent, {@link #choose} picks the ones that are marked, and
 * the ones an earlier batch of the same kind held back that have been marked since, into a new set,
 * and nothing else. Each card picked counts as sent: its mark is spent. The other cards of the batch
 * are kept as held back, with the send that held them, for 24 hours and up to {@link #MAX_HELD} of
 * them, because Facebook counts a card as reported before it sends and won't queue it again until
 * it restarts. A tap on a held card can then send it through that same send. A mark waits 24 hours
 * at most for a send to carry it. All of it is kept in memory only, so it lapses when Facebook's
 * process ends.
