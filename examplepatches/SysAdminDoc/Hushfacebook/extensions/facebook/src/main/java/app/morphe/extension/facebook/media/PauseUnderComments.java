/**
 * Pause reels while comments are open (#266): the reel playing on screen stops when its comment
 * sheet opens and goes on from where it stopped when the sheet closes.
 *
 * <p>Open comments at full height already hands {@link #sheetOpened} the views of every comment
 * sheet as Facebook sets them up. With the switch on, the reel playing on screen then is paused
 * through Tap to play's player bridge, the same BY_USER pause a feed video's play/pause button
 * sends. While a sheet that paused one is open, {@link #holdsStart} keeps any reel from starting by
 * itself: the Reels tab's sheet keeps its reel behind it, and Facebook starts it again as the sheet
 * settles. A start you ask for (BY_USER) still plays. When the sheet's views leave the window and
 * don't come back, the reel that was paused starts again, armed in Tap to play first so its gate
 * doesn't hold a start no tap made.
 *
 * <p>Off, or without Tap to play's bridge in the build, nothing is paused or held.
 *
 * <p>Tap a reel above its comments plays or pauses the reel under the Reels tab's sheet through
 * {@link #tapReel}, the same bridge, whether this switch is on or not.
