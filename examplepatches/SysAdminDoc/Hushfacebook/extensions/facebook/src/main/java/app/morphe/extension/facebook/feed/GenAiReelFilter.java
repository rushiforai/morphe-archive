/**
 * The GenAI rule for Reels and Watch: takes the reels and videos Facebook's own detection marked as
 * made with AI out of each page before it reaches the Reels item collection, the way the sponsored
 * reels filter takes the ads out, at the same two levels.
 *
 * <p>The Reels viewer draws its AI label from an attribution model of GraphQL type
 * {@link #ATTRIBUTION_TYPE} in the reel's attribution list, and that model carries
 * {@code was_detected_as_ai_generated} as a boolean of its own, beside the creator's
 * {@code was_self_disclosed_as_ai_generated}. Facebook finds the attribution with a static helper
 * that takes the reel's model and the type name, and the patch writes that helper into
 * {@link #transparencyAttribution}, because the model's class and the helper are Redex names. The
 * flag is then read through {@code TreeJNI.getBooleanValue}, the kept reader Facebook's own label
 * decision calls on the same attribution. A Watch video that comes as a GraphQLStory carries the
 * feed's flag instead, and it is read the way the feed rule reads it ({@link GenAiLabel}).
 *
 * <p>The Reels tab's own items hold neither in a field of their own (the S22 counted "no model" for
 * every one of 20). Each keeps the reel's model and its story together in a holder object, beside
 * raw trees of its own (580 {@code LX/857} with holder {@code LX/7bV}, 577 {@code LX/71s} with
 * {@code LX/7Z9}; the Reels viewer takes its model out of that holder). For such an item a second
 * reader takes over: it reads {@code ai_generated_detected_info.was_detected_as_ai_generated} by
 * the fields' keys, through {@code TreeJNI.getTree(int)} and the same kept readers, on the model
 * and story the holder keeps and on the item's own trees. That is the field Facebook's Reels menu
 * reads on the reel's model to offer its "AI info" row, and the one the feed rule reads on a post.
 * Its kinds start with {@link #TREE}. Both readers ask both of Facebook's signals, the way its Reels
 * menu does: the attribution of whichever reel model the item keeps first, then that model's own
 * detected info.
 *
 * <p>Only a definite true hides anything. A reel with no such attribution, one whose flag is unset
 * or false, an item holding neither a reel model nor a story nor a tree, and anything this can't
 * read all stay, each counted under its own reason so a report says why. A reel only its creator
 * labelled as AI has the attribution with the flag false, and stays too.
