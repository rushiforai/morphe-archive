/**
 * Hold a reel for 2x: a reel you hold plays at double speed until you let go.
 *
 * <p>Facebook's Reels controls already have this, behind server flags most accounts don't get: a
 * long press on a reel's left or right edge speeds it up, and the reel's touch listener puts the
 * speed back when the finger lifts. Without the flags, a long press opens Facebook's long-press
 * menu instead. The patch hands this class Facebook's answers where the controls decide:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #longPress}: the speed-up flag, where a long press on a reel chooses between the
 *       speed-up and the menu. Yes while the switch is on, so the hold speeds the reel up instead
 *       of opening the menu. The menu is still one tap away on the reel's more button. Ads open
 *       the menu whatever the flag says.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #held}: the handler has taken the speed-up path, past the flag, the ad check and
 *       the edge check. That's a hold.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #anywhere}: the check of whether the press landed on an edge. Yes while the switch
 *       is on, so a hold anywhere on the reel counts.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #holdSpeed}: the speed a hold plays at, which the speed-up, the speed the lift puts
 *       back and the 2x label all read. Outside the Video tab Facebook answers a fixed 2x, and where
 *       an account's Reels live in the Video tab it answers a server value, which may say normal
 *       speed where the server never gave the feature. While on, anything not faster than normal
 *       is 2x.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #speedUp}: the speed-up flag where the controls decide whether to give a reel its
 *       release listener. Yes while the switch is on, so every reel has one.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #release}: both flags the release listener asks before it puts the speed back.
 *       Yes from a hold until a lift the listener hears, since it hears every touch and would
 *       otherwise put back the speed the reel had before its last hold, undoing a speed picked in
 *       the menu since then. It puts the speed back on a lift or a cancel, so once one reaches it
 *       during a hold, the hold is over from the next gesture on. A lift it doesn't hear leaves the
 *       hold for the next one: the listener is drawn with the reel, and a lift before the speed-up
 *       has it drawn again can reach one that lets it go by, or none. {@link #touch} sees each
 *       gesture start and end first.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #speedSet}: every speed FbGrootPlayer's speed setter gets. A hold's speed-up has the
 *       player's speed read through its getter first, and the hold's lift puts that speed back in
 *       place of the one Facebook noted, which is normal speed on a reel Keep the reel speed started
 *       at a kept 2x, and on one a listener drawn before a pick puts back.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>With Debug logging on, {@link #speedSet} logs the speed a hold speeds a reel up to and the one
 * its lift puts back, which tells what a muted reel plays at. A tap still plays or pauses, a double
 * tap and the side buttons work as before, and reels that are ads keep Facebook's long-press menu.
 * Off, paused, before the settings are ready, or when anything here fails, every answer is
 * Facebook's own.
 *
 * <p>Keep the reel speed brings {@link #touch}, {@link #held}, {@link #speedSet} and
 * {@link #release} along too, for the accounts Facebook gives its own hold. There the release
 * listener is on every reel, hears every lift, and puts back the speed the reel was drawn at, so a
 * tap or the start of a swipe took a reel picked at 1.5x back to normal speed (issue #25). With Keep
 * the reel speed on and this switch off or not in the build, Facebook's flags keep their answers
 * during Facebook's own hold, its lift gets the speed from before the hold, and outside a hold the
 * listener is told no, so it leaves the speed alone.
