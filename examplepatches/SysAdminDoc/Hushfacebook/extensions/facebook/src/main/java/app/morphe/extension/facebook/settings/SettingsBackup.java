/**
 * Hushfacebook's switches as a file, and back.
 *
 * <p>Morphe Manager can export the patches that were picked and the signing key. It can't see the
 * switches, which live in Facebook's own data, so a reinstall or a new phone started them all
 * over. This writes them to a JSON file the person chooses and reads one back.
 *
 * <p>Only the switches in {@link #ALLOWLIST} and the settings in {@link #VALUES} (the word
 * filter's two lists, the top folder saves go to, the save folder and its video and photo
 * subfolders, the save quality, the video file name, what a tap on Download does, the app links go
 * to, the tab Facebook opens on, the order comments open in, the qualities videos, reels and
 * video stories play at, the hours notification quiet hours start and end, and how long the app lock waits) go out or come in. Pause, safe mode, the debug settings, the app language
 * and the counters Hushfacebook keeps for itself stay out, and so do the log, the diagnostic data
 * and anything about the person or the phone: a file is a format name, a version number, one true
 * or false per switch, two word lists, one top folder, one folder name and two subfolder names,
 * one save quality, one file name template, one download action, one package name or none, one
 * tab, one comment order, three playback qualities, two hours and one lock time. The word lists go only into the file the
 * person picks, with the rest. An import applies what it read in one preference commit. A file
 * that is too large, isn't JSON, names something twice, holds a value of the wrong type, a word
 * list that isn't one clean list, word lists past the room they share, a folder or a template
 * that isn't one clean name, an app that isn't a package name, or a top folder, quality, download
 * action, tab, comment order or lock time this build doesn't offer, or comes from a newer version changes
 * nothing.
 * <p>The release check stays out of the file: it puts the phone online, so it's switched on
 * from the phone's own screen, never by a file.
 *
 * <p>Call the file and preference work on a worker thread.
