/**
 * Force dark mode: Facebook's dark mode controller answers dark while the switch is on (#64).
 *
 * <p>Facebook's Settings page comes from its server, and on some tablets it has no Dark mode row,
 * so there's no way to turn dark mode on there, and the AMOLED and Material You themes only show in
 * dark mode. Each answer the controller gives passes through here on its way to {@link DarkMode},
 * which keeps it, so the themes see the forced answer too. Meta's own end-to-end tests force dark
 * mode at the same place: the controller answers dark before it reads the setting.
 *
 * <p>Off, paused, before the settings are ready, in a build without the patch, or when anything
 * here fails, the answer is Facebook's own. Facebook asks as each screen applies its theme, so a
 * change shows fully once Facebook restarts.
