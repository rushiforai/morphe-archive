/**
 * Keeps a double tap on a reel or a video from liking it. See DoubleTapAnchors.kt for where a double
 * tap likes and where the hooks go.
 *
 * Over nearly every player, the gesture view's double-tap handler reads as absent while the switch
 * is on, which is how Facebook builds a player without a double-tap like: no heart plays and the
 * tap goes no further. The view's other gestures, the double-tap seek included, and a single tap
 * are untouched. Behind that, the reel like helper's double-tap like finds no key for the reel,
 * which stops the players that call it themselves before the reel's sidebar hears of it, and the
 * helper's like holds back a like whose source is a double tap. The feed attachment that plays its
 * own heart leaves its double tap unhandled. The Like button likes as before.
 *
 * Off in the default selection: a double tap to like is a gesture people use on purpose, so taking
 * it away is a choice to make, as with Tap to play. Picked, its switch starts on.
