/**
 * Where a fetched page enters the Reels and Watch item collection, and the ad item base class.
 *
 * Facebook does not splice ads into Reels on the device. A logging build showed items reaching the
 * collection only as whole fetched pages, never one at a time, with the ad already in the page
 * beside the organic reels -- the server inlines it. So the page arriving at the collection is the
 * only place left to drop it, the same way the news feed patch rejects an edge rather than trying
 * to prevent its insertion. Every filter of a page, the ad filter and the GenAI one, goes on these
 * methods, each prepended with a call that hands the page to the extension and goes on with what
 * comes back. The one-item insert hands its item over as a one-item page and is skipped when the
 * answer is empty.
 *
 * Nothing obfuscated is named. The task that inserts an SFD ad carries a trace literal, and its
 * constructor is handed both the collection and the ad item -- so one string anchor yields both
 * classes, each picked out by a shape no sibling parameter shares.
