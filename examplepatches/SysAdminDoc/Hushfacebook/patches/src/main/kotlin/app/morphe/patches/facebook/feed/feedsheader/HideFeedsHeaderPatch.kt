 * the fragment's [NAV_BAR_QUESTION] answers yes, so each answer it returns goes through the
 * extension, which says no while the switch is on. The filters go in the container the fragment
 * keeps in [FILTERS_FIELD], which it adds to its view hidden and hands, in [ON_CREATE_VIEW], to the
 * controller that fills it and shows it once the filters load (580 `LX/OHa;`, 577 `LX/aEY;`). Right
 * before that controller is made, while the switch is on, the container in the register it gets
 * is swapped for a new one built the way the fragment builds its own, which is never put on
 * screen, so Facebook's container stays hidden. The posts would still sit as far down as the
 * filters are tall, since the controller in [CONTAINER_CONTROLLER_FIELD] moves them there once it
 * hears the filters show, through the runnable Redex names [ROOM_RUNNABLE] (581 `LX/b6e;`, 580
 * `LX/eZX;`, 577 `LX/bBz;`). That runnable's answer to whether they show goes through the extension too, which
 * says no while the switch is on, so the posts start at the top.
