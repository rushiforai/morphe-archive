/**
 * Removes the row of stories at the top of the news feed, Create story included, and the
 * "What's on your mind?" composer row above it.
 *
 * The tray is never an edge, so the feed guard can't see it (a debug log of every edge on a
 * signed-in 580 showed none while the tray was on screen). It is an adapter the feed's adapter
 * configuration adds, in one of two methods (see Fingerprints.kt), and each returns its adapter's
 * class, a final one. The patch gives both classes a getItemCount() that asks the extension with
 * what Facebook's own count says, and the extension answers 0 while the switch is on. The feed
 * builds its adapters once per feed view but reads their counts on every change, a pull to
 * refresh among them, so the switch shows then, either way, with no restart (seen on a Galaxy
 * S25 with Facebook 581, 2026-10-05). Off by default: stories are people's own posts.
 *
 * The composer row is an adapter of the same list, handed over by a getter of the same
 * configuration class, and its class is final and counts through the same superclass chain, so it
 * gets the same count under a kind of its own and a switch of its own, which starts off.
 *
 * The rows of Stories Facebook puts between posts are edges, DiscoverFeedUnit ones, so the feed
 * guard this patch brings takes them out under the independent between-posts switch (issue #45), and the tray too
 * should it ever come as an edge, a StoriesTrayFeedUnit one. So do the single large Stories tile
 * and the single person's Stories viewer the same model answers through its table of type names,
 * StoriesOneColumnOneRowLargeTileFeedUnit and StoriesSingleBucketInlineViewerFeedUnit
 * (StoriesBetweenPostsFixtureTest finds both in every declared build). Hide suggested and
 * promoted posts takes out the rows of Stories from people you aren't connected to on its own
 * switch.
