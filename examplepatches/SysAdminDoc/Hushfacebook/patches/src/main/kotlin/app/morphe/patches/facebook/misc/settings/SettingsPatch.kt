 *
 * Meta's Facebook builds for Android 9 (arm64-v8a) and Android 8 (armeabi-v7a) ship one startup
 * dex, 4,420 classes in 580.0.0.51.74 for Android 9, and pack the rest of the code into a compressed
 * Superpack archive, `assets/secondary-program-dex-jars/store-0.dex.spo`, which the patcher can't
 * read (checked 2026-09-26: 0 of 26 patches apply). The application class is in the startup dex and
 * the main tab activity isn't, so without this the settings patch stopped saying no class of the
 * activity's hierarchy declares onCreate, which named the symptom and not the build.
