/*
 * How the Feeds tab picks one of its filters from an intent, on the 577 and 580 builds (#56).
 *
 * The Feeds tab is com.facebook.feed.fragment.FeedFiltersFragment, whether it's on the tab bar or
 * opened from the Menu, and Redex keeps the names below. Its handleDeeplinkFromMainActivity(Intent)
 * is how the main screen hands it an intent: with one, it reads the feed type the tab last showed,
 * a static FeedType a usage tracker keeps (loaded once from the preference
 * "/feed_filters/last_feed_used"), asks the tab's state where that feed type is among its filters,
 * a lookup that answers -1 when they haven't got it, and has the filter controller pick the filter
 * at that position. The state holds two lists of filters, the usual one and the one for the most
 * recent posts, and the lookup searches whichever it has a flag for. The main screen calls the
 * handler only from onNewIntent, for an intent asking for it or a tab that always wants one, so a
 * start from the launcher icon never does.
 *
 * The patch puts the extension's FeedsSubtabRoute in three places. Right after the handler reads
 * the last feed type, the extension's answer takes its place, the chosen filter's feed type while
 * the extension asks and the same one the rest of the time, cast back to a FeedType before the
 * lookup reads it. Right after the lookup answers, the answer goes through the extension unchanged,
 * which is how it knows the tab had the feed type it asked for. And at each return of the tab's
 * onResume, the extension is handed the tab, so it can call the handler once after a start that
 * asked for a filter. It finds each feed type among FeedType's public constants by the name it keeps.
