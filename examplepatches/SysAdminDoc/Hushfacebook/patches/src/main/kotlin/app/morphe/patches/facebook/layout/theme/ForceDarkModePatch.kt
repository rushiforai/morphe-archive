/**
 * Facebook's dark mode controller answers dark while the switch is on (#64). Facebook's Settings
 * page comes from its server, and on some tablets it has no Dark mode row. The controller's
 * answer already goes through the extension for the two themes ([hookDarkModeAnswer]), and the
 * extension turns a light answer dark there, before it keeps it, so the themes see dark mode on.
 * Meta's end-to-end tests force dark mode in the same method: it answers dark before it reads the
 * setting when their switch is set. With a theme in the build too, the one hook serves both.
