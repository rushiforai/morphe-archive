/**
 * Lets Meta's own apps install beside a re-signed Facebook. See SharedPermissions.kt for which
 * permissions collide and why they're renamed rather than taken out.
 *
 * The code half follows the manifest: Facebook's code names FB_APP_COMMUNICATION when it registers
 * a receiver only its family may reach and when it sends a broadcast only its family may receive
 * (the cross-app broadcast manager, the MQTT service's receiver, the zero-rating switch, the login
 * state broadcast and Profilo's trace control, six places on 577 and 580). Left alone they'd name a
 * permission this build no longer holds, and those broadcasts would stop reaching Facebook itself.
 *
 * Letting a same-key Messenger, Messenger Lite or Facebook Lite sign in through this Facebook is
 * Restore screens on re-signed builds' job, not this one's: that patch hooks the one method Facebook
 * reads a package's signers through, and the same-key answer it gives a family caller there needs
 * nothing from this patch. A same-key Facebook and Messenger pair installs fine without this patch
 * too, since both declare Facebook's stock shared permission names under the same signer; this patch
 * only keeps a Meta-signed Messenger, Facebook Lite, Business Suite or Workplace from colliding with
 * a re-signed Facebook's copy of those names.
 *
 * No switch: a manifest can't change at run time, so the patch stays in while paused.
