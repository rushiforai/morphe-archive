/**
 * Hides feed posts whose own text holds a word or phrase the person listed, unless it also holds
 * one from their keep list.
 *
 * The rule runs in the shared feed guard like every other feed rule, so `addNewEdgeToCollection`
 * still carries one Hushfacebook guard. What this patch adds there are the two reads the guard
 * can't make by name: GraphQLStory's accessors of its message and of the post a share wraps, which
 * Redex renames every build. Each is found by the two schema keys it loads (see PostTextAnchors.kt)
 * and written into a stub on `PostText`, which answers a marker until then. The message accessor is
 * also held to GraphQLStory's own toString, which labels its text "message.text" and reads it as
 * the field `text`; the extension reads the same field through the kept `getCachedString(int)`.
 *
 * The same patch hides posts from the people, Pages and sites the person lists: GraphQLStory's
 * accessors of its authors and its attachments go into PostSources' two stubs (see
 * PostSourceAnchors.kt), and a build where they can't be found keeps the words and leaves that list
 * reading nothing. Its four switches for kinds of post (photo, video, link and colored background
 * posts) read an attachment's styles and the story's text format through PostTypes' two stubs (see
 * PostTypeAnchors.kt), which a build without them leaves unfilled in the same way. Its reaction
 * ceiling reads a story's feedback and the feedback's reactors through PostReactions' two stubs (see
 * ReactionAnchors.kt), and counts them with the kept `getCachedInt(int)`.
 *
 * The lists live in Hushfacebook's settings on the phone. Nothing here reads a post until a
 * switch is on and its list has something in it, and nothing of the text, the names or the lists
 * goes into a log, the diagnostic report or a request.
