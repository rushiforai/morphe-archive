/**
 * Hides feed posts, reels and Watch videos that Facebook's own detection marked as made with AI.
 *
 * The feed rule runs in the shared feed guard like every other feed rule, so `addNewEdgeToCollection`
 * still carries one Hushfacebook guard. What this patch adds there is the one read the guard can't
 * make by name: GraphQLStory's accessor of the detected-AI info model, which Redex renames every
 * build. It is found by the two schema keys it loads (see Fingerprints.kt), held to the model
 * GenAiTransparencyPlugin reads the flag on, and written into `GenAiLabel.detectedInfo`, which
 * answers a marker until then. Everything else, the flag included, the extension reads through
 * members Facebook keeps.
 *
 * The same plugin reads a second flag beside it, `was_self_disclosed_as_ai_generated` on the
 * story's self-disclosure model, and shows the label on that flag alone: that's a post its creator
 * labelled as AI. Its accessor is found and held to the plugin the same way and written into
 * `GenAiLabel.selfDisclosureInfo`, for the opt-in switch that hides those posts too.
 *
 * A fifth switch takes out posts featuring one of Meta's AI characters. Facebook asks for such a
 * post's attachment style through a finder of its own, and this patch writes GraphQLStory's
 * attachments accessor and a call of that finder into `AiCharacterPosts` (see AiCharacterAnchors.kt).
 * That rule is the newest and least needed here, so a build whose anchors moved only loses it: the
 * patch log says why, the stubs stay unfilled, and Hook status names what's missing while its switch
 * is on.
 *
 * The Reels rule runs where a fetched page enters the Reels and Watch item collection, on the same
 * three methods the sponsored reels filter runs on, each prepended with a call of its own; the two
 * patches work alone or together. What this patch adds there is Facebook's own finder of the
 * attribution the Reels viewer draws its AI label from, found by the type name literal it is
 * handed (see ReelLabel.kt) and written into `GenAiReelFilter.transparencyAttribution`. The flag
 * on that attribution the extension reads through `TreeJNI.getBooleanValue`, the kept reader the
 * viewer's own label decision calls, and the patch stops if that decision no longer does. The
 * Reels tab's own items keep the model and the story in a holder rather than a field of their
 * own, and for those the extension reads `ai_generated_detected_info` by its key through
 * `TreeJNI.getTree(int)`, which the patch requires too (see ReelLabel.kt).
 *
 * Every switch but the Meta AI cards' starts off. Nobody has yet recorded a signed-in feed with one
 * AI-labeled post and one ordinary post beside it, a Reels feed with an AI-labelled reel or a post
 * featuring an AI character, and until someone does, each rule waits to be turned on. The cards are
 * Facebook's own promotion, not anyone's post, so that switch starts on.
