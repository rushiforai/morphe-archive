 *
 * Modified for Hushfacebook (Facebook), 2026: only the Following feed swap of its
 * fix/following-feed-home branch is taken. The builder is found by a literal it keeps instead of
 * 573's obfuscated names, the feed types by the names they keep, and the swap is the extension's,
 * behind a switch. Home is swapped to the most recent feed instead of the Following feed, whose
 * style Facebook's servers no longer honour for every account.

 * Has Home ask for the newest posts from the friends, groups and Pages you follow, the feed the
 * Feeds tab's All shows, instead of the ranked one.
 *
 * Facebook's NewsFeedQueryParamsPreparer builds every news feed request's parameters, and one of
 * its static helpers, handed the feed type second, sets the query's feed style from it:
 * MOST_RECENT_FEED_DEFAULT for the most recent feed types, FAVORITES_FEED and the rest for the
 * Feeds tab's other filters, FOLLOWING_FEED for the Following feed's type, and Home's own ordering
 * for Home's. It's the one method that opens the "Companion.setPagedNewsfeedParams" trace section
 * (581 `LX/1bb;->A02`), and the preparer's prepare method is its one caller. Every later read of
 * the feed type in it, the call it ends on included, reads the parameter, so a feed type put there
 * first is the one the whole request is built for.
 *
 * The patch hands the parameter to the extension's FollowingHome first thing and keeps its answer
 * there. While the switch is on, Home's feed type ("top_stories") comes back as the most recent
 * feed's ("most_recent"), both public constants of FeedType the extension finds by those names.
 * Every other feed type comes back as it was. Froggo's swap answered the Following feed's type
 * ("following_feed"), but on the S22 test account (581, 2026-10-08) Facebook answered that request
 * with the ranked feed, suggestions and all.
 *
 * In the default selection with its switch off: it only acts once the switch is turned on.
