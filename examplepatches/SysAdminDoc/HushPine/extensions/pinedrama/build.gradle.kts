// Robolectric 4.17 asks for Bouncy Castle 1.85 twice: by name, through the bc-jdk18on-bom it
// imports, and with no version of its own for the bcprov module that BOM governs. Every request
// in this module is rewritten to the reviewed release so related test libraries cannot resolve
// at mixed versions. No production configuration contains this group, so none of it reaches
// the MPE payload.
//
// Checking the resolved graph afterwards would prove nothing: the rewrite above guarantees the
// answer, so a "wrong resolved version" branch could never run. What the rewrite hides, and what
// is worth failing on, is the request underneath it. When Robolectric moves to a version nobody
// has looked at, this build stops instead of quietly rewriting it away.

// without one is a request nothing in this file chose the version for.

// Reading the constraint behind such a request instead was tried on 2026-09-15 and is worthless:
